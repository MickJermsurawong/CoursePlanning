           This course provides students with a broad overview of the discipline, history, research methods, and selected contemporary issues in the field. The approach taken selects key ethnographies and uses them to explore questions of methodological, theoretical, and substantive nature. This course is designed to introduce students to anthropological investigation and to facilitate understanding of how the discipline engages with and represents the everyday realities, challenges, and concerns of the people with whom anthropologists work.

           How have anthropologists encountered, written about, and produced the “Arab world” over the past century? Beginning with early Western travelers’ imaginaries of Arabia and ending with an ethnographic memoir, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.  Through ethnography, literature, film and field-trips, we will explore such topics as gender, sociality and identity; military conflict and war; disease, bioethics and Islam; pilgrimage and piety; labor migration, refugees, and diaspora; globalization, media and mediation; and the Arab uprisings.

           This course provides an overview of Arabic literature since the nineteenth century. The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.

           At the crossroads between Asia, Africa and Europe, the region that Europeans and North Americans labeled "The Middle East" presents a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape of peninsulas and isthmuses, republics and monarchies, oil producing countries, and labor exporting nations. This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010–2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

           Islam changed and shaped the Middle East, the Mediterranean world, and South Asia following its emergence in the seventh century. Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi’a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

           From the beginning of the 8th to the beginning of the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

           How do those who live in “the Middle East” relate to their past(s), and what discourses do they draw on to represent and authorize it today?  How is “the past” recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage. This course includes a class trip to Turkey.

           At the western end of the Mediterranean, the religious, political, and economic histories of North Africa and Iberia have always been intertwined. This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711–1492 when various parts of the Iberian peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war. The course includes an extended trip through Morocco and Spain.

           In this course we immerse ourselves in the lives and culture of the Arab merchant communities that settled in China from the early days of Islam until the early modern period. We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the "Arabian Seas." We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history—the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.

           This course examines the history and culture of the Jews in the medieval Islamic world, beginning with the historiographical debate about this contentious subject. The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur’an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

           This course will cover major turning points in modern Iran, from the 1906 Constitutional Revolution to the 1979 Islamic Revolution  and since. Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini’s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state’s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.

           This course provides an overview of the issues surrounding global energy supplies, oil’s unique economic properties, and its role in shaping the political economy of the Middle East and U.S. strategic interests in the region. We begin by discussing the basic science and availability of energy sources, the state of technology, the functioning of energy markets, the challenges of coping with global climate change and the key role of the oil reserves in the Middle East. The second part of the course focuses on the history of oil in the Middle East and its impact on societies in the region.

           This course is an introduction to the study of Saudi Arabia and can be taken as a gateway course to the Arab Crossroads concentration. Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

           This course examines two simultaneous processes in the Middle East since the mid-20th century: 1) how war has become mediatized, and 2) how media has been militarized. Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies – including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet – are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

           We use fiction as a tool to visit (figuratively) five cities: Cairo, Alexandria, Beirut, Haifa, and Baghdad. The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

           This course is an exploration of modern architecture in the city. Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.

           This seminar introduces students to the main theoretical and epistemological trends in the study of the Arab crossroads region, and offers practical examples of the methodologies used by scholars in the humanities and the qualitative social sciences. We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

           The culmination of the program is a two-semester capstone experience, which provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. Seniors take a capstone seminar in the first semester and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. In the tutorial, students work with a faculty mentor to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a senior thesis. The capstone experience culminates in a public presentation of the senior thesis.

           Everyone talks about memory, yet nobody knows quite what it is. The basic question, what is memory, is unresolved: is memory located in the brain, or is it a complex of activities characteristic of the mind or psyche? We speak of personal memories, repressed memories, communal memories—the list goes on. This course introduces the rich variety of ideas, activities, and artifacts all said to be about memory. Among them are memory and place, memory and time, how societies remember, the art of memory, remembering the future, memory and creativity, and metaphors of memory.

           Humans have created a stunning variety of cultures, yet different civilizations have often developed in comparable ways. This course explores similarities and differences in the long run: are there patterns in world history, and why did civilizations develop the way they did? How did humanity come to grow together by forging connections over ever greater distances? We address these questions by taking a global view of humanity, from hunter-gatherers up to the beginnings of modern globalization 500 years ago. We examine the biological evolution of humans; the creation of art and religion; the origins of agriculture; the invention of hierarchy, gender inequality, and slavery; and the rise of cities, states, and empires.

           This course concerns the aesthetics and politics of translation, both as a historically and culturally situated practice and as a rich metaphor for cultural production, cross-cultural encounter, and other types of creation, appropriation, and change. The course emphasizes transformations that occur in cross-media translations, such as when poems are set to music and books are turned into films. In addition to writing a number of short, critical essays on translations broadly conceived, studies create literary and/or cross-media translations of their own. Students perform their translations at the end of the semester.

           This course explores the artistic and intellectual avant-gardes, counter-cultures, and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s from a global perspective, assessing their impact on individual identities, social and gender hierarchies, domestic politics, and international relations during the Cold War. It traces the history of the various protest movements and the plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large. Course materials draw on the most recent historiography, as well as literature, film, art, music, and oral history.

           The aim of this course is to explore and draw inspiration from the scientific process, its representations, and data. The goal is to cultivate purposeful science communication and to encourage critical responses to scientific and technological practice in modern culture. Students focus on a particular area of science and become familiar with its process, language, and data. From direct experiences with scientists and science students, students will propose their own art/science collisions and develop one idea as a media/interactive presentation for the final project.

           With the growing numbers of immigrants and refugees from the Middle East/North Africa in cities such as London, Paris, Berlin, Barcelona, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and Sao Paulo, the construction of “us” versus “them” can no longer correspond to one geography, simplistically imagined as “over there.” This seminar studies questions of displacement as represented, mediated, and narrated in a wide variety of texts. It focuses especially on memoirs, whether in written or audiovisual form, which confront exclusionary and essentialist discourses with a rich cultural production that foregrounds a complex understanding of such issues as “home,” “homeland,” “exile,” “hybridity,” and “minorities.”

           Humanism – which in some parts coincides with Renaissance – was a cultural movement initiated in Italy in the 14th century, spreading all over Europe until it reached its end in the 17th century. Its programmatic energy derived from the desire to remember something that seemed to have been obliterated and forgotten in the course of the Middle Ages, i.e. pagan antiquity. Basing their European – national and transnational identities – on something much older than Christianity, scholars (poets, painters, architects, composers and philosophers) revived and developed scientifically the Greek and Roman legacy and laid the founding stones for Enlightenment and Modernity.

           At the global art market's most recent peak in 2007, American Pop artist Andy Warhol (1928-1987) edged out Pablo Picasso to become the world's highest earning painter at auction. Although he has recently ceded that position to Chinese artists Zhang Daqian (1899-1983) and Qi Baishi (1864-1957), Warhol remains one of the most influential forces in contemporary art worldwide. From his famous Campbell's soup cans to his enduring aphorism that "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for fifteen minutes," Warhol's art and thinking saturate contemporary culture. This seminar uses his diaries and other writing as a base-line against which we will examine his 25-year career as a painter, filmmaker, publisher and music producer, TV personality, and artistic mentor and collaborator, as well as his legacy in what has been described as our "Warhol economy." What can Warhol's output and reception tell us about class, gender and sexuality, religion, and media over the last half century? And how should we understand his role in the making of global culture today?

           Is there such a thing as global cultural heritage? This course resituates Herman Melville's Moby-Dick -- often described as "The Great American Novel" -- as a global text that is "worldly" in its outlook and its legacy. The course examines the novel's relation to Christian, Muslim, and Zoroastrian religious traditions; to Greco-Roman tragedy and epic; to Shakespeare; to Western and Eastern philosophical traditions; and to a variety of European, British, and American Romantic traditions. It also examines the novel's engagement with the visual arts. The course poses three sets of questions: 1) In what ways was Moby-Dick a “global” text in its own day, adopting a “worldly” approach that transcends its particular local milieu? 2) How has the history of the publication, criticism, and teaching of the novel transformed it into a global cultural work? 3) What is the cultural legacy of the book today throughout a variety of global media forms, including plays, films, novels, operas, and works of visual art?

           Every society cares deeply about its children, but every society cares for its children differently. This global examination of children will discuss common themes and cultural variations. We will consider child labor, children in cities, children and war, and the changing historical nature of the family in America, Europe, and China. We discuss education and health in global perspective, looking at children in the urban world of the 21st century, with field trips to the Shanghai Children’s Palace, the Shanghai Children’s Hospital, a school, an orphanage.  Each student will report to the class on some particular theme of childhood in comparative cultural perspective.

           One may well call European and especially German history in the 20th century eventful. As the German capital, Berlin saw the transition of the German Empire to a functioning if turbulent democratic state in 1918. The rise of the Nazis to power and their defeat in WW II led to the notorious division of the city which then belonged to two states. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, German reunification was imminent. The course will engage with Berlin as a city of memory as represented in places and reflected in literature. Visits include: Checkpoint Charlie; the Berlin Wall; the Reichstag; the Olympic stadium and village; the Bauhaus Archive and Museum; and the Gemäldegalerie.

           In the 15th and 16th centuries, the city of Florence was a center of immense creativity in every area of human understanding and endeavor. It was the center of that extraordinary moment we call "the Renaissance"—the revolution in art, architecture, politics, philosophy and science that has shaped our view of the world, and the place of human beings in it. In this seminar, we read representative writings from several of the great Florentine thinkers of the period—Alberti, Machiavelli, Pico, and Galileo. Our goal is twofold: to discover what was original in each, and to grasp how all were connected by a shared set of ideals and beliefs. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to the main cultural monuments of Florence, where we see (among other wonders) the palaces and churches that Alberti designed, the telescope through which Galileo spied the moons of Jupiter, and the tomb where Machiavelli lies.

           With astonishing speed—mere decades in the middle of the eighteenth century—Enlightenment not only transformed how we think about ourselves, through new concepts of individuality and community, liberty and verifiable truth, it also remade Britain’s cities and institutions. Imagine London without the British Museum (1759) or the Royal Academy (1768). Imagine our curriculum without Johnson’s Dictionary (1755) or the Encyclopedia Britannica (1768). 250 years later, we will use the resources of the Global Network University to recover how this revolution in methods, tools, and institutions recast inquiry and enterprise in the West and to consider what we might do with our Enlightenment inheritance now. Behind-the-scenes adventures into London’s museums, galleries, and civic societies allow us to add our own tracks to the intellectual map we draw in class.

           Prague should have been destroyed during the Second World War, like other major cities in Europe, but somehow it wasn't. The remarkable survival of this exquisite city allows us to explore Central European history and culture in the context of a completely preserved inner urban core dating back to the Middle Ages. Drawing upon primary source readings, cartography, musical performances, art and architecture, the course illuminates the way crosscurrents of European culture became focused in Prague between 1400 and the present. In addition to academic encounters with such figures as Mucha, Kafka, Mozart, and Kundera, the course includes walking tours around Prague, trips to museums and concerts, excursions outside the city, and interactions with leading local performers and thinkers.

           Ever since the late seventeenth century, thinkers calling themselves "modern" have sought to establish a sense of their relationship to ancient history and thought. Florence has played a major role in these efforts and in the very idea of what modernity is. First, because Florence has remained intimately associated with the Renaissance, and thus with a literary, aesthetic, and scientific return to the Ancients. And second, because it is seen as a birthplace of modern political thought—especially republicanism and the theory of the state. In this class we will study the place of Florence in the modern imagination. We follow in the footsteps, both textual and actual, of thinkers who looked back to the past, and even at themselves, through the Florentine lens, and who asked what it means to be modern, to look to “the ancients,” and to look at the Renaissance as a cultural rebirth, by way of the city and its cultural heroes.

           As cultural traditions have for the most part carried the voices of men, this course will consider the question: what can we learn from listening to women?  We will listen to a range of women’s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (“A World Apart”) and Haifaa al-Mansour (“Wadjda”); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (The Fragility of Goodness) and Leila Ahmed (Border Passage). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.

           This course introduces students to several genres of literature—drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story—and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism.  We will be examining conceptions of nature and how “the natural” is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion.  Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings.  In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective.  In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally.  Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.

           An interdisciplinary look at different ways of construing the self and how they both affect and are affected by culture, with a focus on China and the arts.  Topics will include the contrast afforded by the West; originality and the Chinese copycat phenomenon; the autobiographical impulse; and hybridity.  Exercises in cultural psychology and readings and lectures on art, architecture and literature will be supplemented by field trips to a variety of museums, such as the Shanghai Museum, the Shikumen Museum, the Rockbund Art Museum, the Chinese Imperial Examination System Museum, and the Propaganda Poster Art Museum, as well as to the Novartis research lab, where cross-cultural issues affecting scientific research are being addressed through architecture.

           Many institutions central to today’s cities – banks, hospitals, civic governments, museums, communal systems of welfare and sustainability – had their testing grounds in the small Tuscan towns of medieval and Renaissance Italy.  These towns also pioneered recognizably modern artistic, cultural, and engineering practices. Florence and Siena were especially vibrant in this transformation of urban life: the one a powerhouse of culture and industry, the other the Wall Street of Europe as it financed entrepreneurs, popes, and Europe’s kings.  Our project for our three weeks together is to figure out what made Florence and Siena tick. We’ll come to know these cities intimately, visiting seats of government and Renaissance orphanages, climbing towers, exploring the home of a fifteenth-century merchant, and prowling a recently-excavated crypt under Siena’s cathedral. We’ll also read and study the utopian (and dystopian) visions of these cities – Lorenzetti’s frescoes of Good Government and Dante’s Inferno -- along with diaries, letters, and constitutions. And to help you hone your writing skills, we’ll read the travelogues of two of Italy’s greatest story-tellers: Marco Polo and Italo Calvino.

           This course offers an introduction to some of the current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia, considering a range of Aboriginal forms of social being, ranging historically and geographically and giving significant focus to the changing relationships between Indigenous people and the settler nation of Australia.  We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination – in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism – in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms.  While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would “die out” and later that they would or could be simply “assimilated,” we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called “the great Australian silence” and asserting their right to a cultural future.  This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme.

           This course is the first in a series of courses meant for students who come from Arabic-speaking families and who grew up in an Arabic-speaking environment but have not had sufficient training in Arabic. These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students’ acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 1 the student will perfect their knowledge of the Arabic writing/reading system; will learn how to produce accurate and coherent sentences in Arabic; and will utilize a variety of audio-visual material to begin to re-discover, debate, and express some of the key characteristics of Arab culture and identity.

           A people's dialect is a representation of their identity and a reflection of their cultural life. Building on the students' prior knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic, this course introduces the students to the unique aspects that make the Emirati dialect so lively and distinctive. From the heart of the ancient oasis of Al Ain where the course is taught, the course also serves as a gateway to accessing intimate aspects of life, culture, and heritage of the Gulf region. Using a bilingual textbook specifically designed by the course instructors to teach Emirati Arabic in formal and informal settings, students learn and experience the target dialect through direct instruction as well as through exploration of Emirati cultural life in folklore, song, film, art, and literature.

           This course is the second in a series of courses meant for students who come from Arabic-speaking families and who grew up in an Arabic-speaking environment but have not had sufficient training in Arabic. These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students’ acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 2 the student will work to perfect their command of Arabic syntax; will learn to produce longer argumentative pieces; will begin to access, assess and taste some of Arabic’s key modern literary and cultural products and will continue to debate, and explore various aspects of Arabic culture.

           This course wraps up the student's sequenced language learning experience with an opportunity to explore the cultural and artistic diversity of the Arab world using the acquired language skills. Students cap their language achievement by accessing and studying such genres as literature, song, film, folklore, etc., in the original language. The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

           This course introduces students to the main stylistic features of classical Arabic. Students get a flavor of an older yet essential register of Arabic through the most important texts of the Islamic tradition. These texts constitute the very core of Islam to this day: the Qur’an and the Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad). The syllabus also includes samples from the Tafsir tradition (Qur’anic hermeneutics), Sufi/mystical literature (poetry and prose), philosophical novels, and pious tales from the popular sphere (the Arabian Nights tradition). The Qur’an provides a sustained focus for the course, with particular attention being paid to how it has influenced all categories of Arabo-Islamic literature: linguistically, stylistically, thematically and doctrinally.

           This course is the last in a series of courses meant for students who come from Arabic-speaking families and who grew up in an Arabic-speaking environment but have not had sufficient training in Arabic. These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students’ acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 3 the student will focus more on understanding and learning some of Arabic’s major rhetorical styles; will continue to study original Arabic literature both classical and contemporary; will produce publication-quality output; and will engage in more critical study of the main intellectual debates in Arab life today.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the goals of each participant.

           The array of organisms that populates the globe is astounding in its diversity and adaptability. This course uses fundamental concepts from the Foundations of Science curriculum to examine essential elements of physiology, with a particular emphasis on humans and disease. This course develops an understanding of the relationship between structure and function of the organism; how structure develops through evolutionary and developmental processes; and how structure is related to the environment surrounding the organism.

           Understanding the fundamental methods for growing and studying cells—the smallest units of life—is basic to biology. This course introduces students to the methods used to study cell structure and function. In the laboratory, students study the fundamentals of cell biology and the experimental approaches used to examine the cell. Topics cover cellular, subcellular, and macromolecule localization; biochemical analysis of the cell; and cell culture techniques. Accurate record-keeping, reports, and presentations are emphasized.

           Molecular biology has revolutionized biological research during the past few decades and has formed the basis for all high-throughput and genomics technologies. This course combines lecture, class discussions, and lab experiments to explore applications of molecular biology in modern biological research, particularly high-throughput biology and genomics. The course engages students in a guided research project to learn basics and advanced high-throughput molecular biology techniques, as well as scientific writing and data reporting. In particular, students carry out high-throughput cloning and sequencing of a set of several hundred DNAs that encode transcription/chromatin factors from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results are analyzed to assess cloning success, accuracy of gene annotation and gene expression under specific growth conditions.

           Multicellular organisms undergo a series of complex temporal and spatial changes in gene expression following fertilization, which results in the highly organized, coordinated cell divisions needed for growth and development. This course introduces students to the principles and experimental strategies of developmental biology. It covers the cellular and molecular basis for patterning in the embryo; the determination of cell fate; cell differentiation; the genes controlling these events; how the genes are identified and studied; and the cellular proteins that effect shape, movement, and signaling among cells.

           Evolution encompasses the patterns and mechanisms that explain the diversity of organisms we observe today and during the millions of years of the geological record. Evidence is reviewed that demonstrates the common ancestry of all living things, including humans, and the mechanisms, such as natural selection, that are required and sufficient to explain this pattern of ancestry, diversification, adaptation, speciation, and biogeographic distribution. The course also uses computer and mathematical modeling to explore the fundamentals of population genetics, molecular evolution, phylogenetic systematics, and the evolution of developmental systems.

           Why do offspring often exhibit physical features of their parents? Why do combinations of certain features in offspring translate into specific characteristics that either enhance or diminish the organism’s fitness? Answers to questions such as these fall partly within the discipline of genetics, which is the study of heredity. Principles from the Foundations of Science curriculum provide a framework for learning about classical genetics, chromosome structure and mutation, gene function and regulation, and aspects of molecular and developmental genetics. Recent studies in human genetics and their applications, particularly to health-related issues, are also investigated.

           Fueled by recent advances in technical approaches to data collection and analysis, the biological sciences have entered a new era in which vast amounts of genome-scale sequence and functional data are becoming available for a large number of species. These data are allowing scientists to explore biological function on an unprecedented scale. Familiarity with the fields of genomics and bioinformatics, which impact society on all levels, is vital for the next generation of scientists. This survey course introduces students to a broad range of topics in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics through lectures and hands-on exercises that use fundamental principles of chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics to understand organismal diversity through analyses of genomes.

           Organismal complexity is reflected in part by the way the individual biochemical pathways, organless and cells function together to permit environmental adapatation. This course covers the computational techniques used to access, analyze, interpret, and integrate the diverse data of complex networks and pathways developed from genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics and to understand how they work together forming a system with definable phenotypes. Global approaches as well as mathematical and statistical modeling to data collection and analyses are performed.

           Biophysics uses the laws of physics and their associated mathematical principles to gain an understanding of living systems, primarily by examining forces and interactions among molecules found in cells. This course begins with a thorough review of cells, with a special emphasis on eukaryotes and their different compartments. This is followed by an investigation of the structures and functions of biological macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. Students gain a deep understanding of information flow in cells via detailed biophysical analysis of replication and gene expression. Ultimately, the principles of biophysics are applied to disease states with an eye toward rational design of therapeutics.

           This course explores how the nervous system develops in normal animals and how genetic and epigenetic factors can disrupt these processes. Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms interleave with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during maturation. A broad range of topics, including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of connections, and plasticity are covered. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating, or neurodegenerative disorders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course are to understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder, and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.

           The capstone seminar provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD biologists and others in related fields. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research Students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.  Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the  junior year; it will be offered every semester.

           The senior Capstone Experience in biology requires students to engage in a long-term, mentored learning experience that cumulates in a piece of original research and/or scientific theory. The specific project is developed during junior year as part of the Capstone Seminar. During the Capstone Project, the proposed work will come to fruition in the form of a research paper typically along the lines of those in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA or PLoS One. Students also participate in a capstone festival during which they present their work to faculty, their peers and guests.

           Every animal on the planet is a master of its universe. Bats fly with great precision in total darkness. Honeybees find their way home using a path they have never seen before. Baby songbirds retain the memory of hearing their father’s song for several months before they actually are able to sing that song themselves. All these animals rely on specific mechanisms in their brains to endow them with these remarkable abilities. Understanding these mechanisms can provide deep insights into how all brains, including our own, are shaped by evolution to be fantastic problem solving machines. In this course we will explore the unique worlds of several animals, highlighting first the specific environmental problems that a particular animal must solve, and second, the amazing ways the brains of these animals implement imaginative solutions to these problems. This course does not presume a strong background in biology, but two things help: an appreciation of the beauty of the animals around us and a genuine curiosity about how in the world they are able to do what they do.

           This course studies the fundamentals of how human groups function and evolve over time and what scholars and practitioners have learned over the last 50 years about making them more effective. The course examines how size, longevity, surrounding social context, member composition, and emergent social norms dramatically shape how a group behaves and how effectively it operates. Then the course turns to study how group behavior can be shaped and changed over time. Particular attention is paid to issues of group culture, status and power structures, communication patterns, member diversity, and the effects of new member entry and member departures.

           This course is best seen as a blend of basic knowledge on how organizations behave and a much deeper exploration of research methods for measuring the actual performance of organizations in achieving their mission, be it profit, environmental sustainability, social responsibility, or innovation.  The course will start with a short discussion of organizational architecture and behavior, then move forward with an introduction to research methods for diagnosing and measuring how organizations produce high rates of return on investment.  The bulk of the course will engage students in measuring the organizational attributes and performance of selected Abu Dhabi entities as part of the professor's work with the Abu Dhabi Accountability Authority, which oversees nearly 400 AD government, private, and nonprofit agencies, and the Khalifa Fund, which is Abu Dhabi's primary venture capital fund for stimulating entrepreneurship. Students must be committed to the highest standards of professionalism in their work, and will be active participants in helping NYUAD contribute to the betterment of Abu Dhabi organizations and society as a whole.  Arabic language skills are of added value in this work, but not essential.

           Organic Chemistry 1 is an undergraduate introductory organic chemistry course that uses an interactive, problems-based approach to study the structure and bonding of organic materials, conformational analysis, stereochemistry and spectroscopy, topics that partly trace their roots to the development of quantum theory. The topics covered include basic reaction mechanisms, such as substitution and elimination, and the reactions of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds, and carboxylic acids. The course incorporates modern analytical methods that are the cornerstone of contemporary organic chemistry.

           This course is the second semester of a comprehensive and rigorous survey of aliphatic and aromatic organic chemistry, with particular emphasis on reactions from both a synthetic as well as a mechanistic viewpoint. The topics include: conjugated systems, aromatic compounds, including phenols and aryl halides as well as a thorough discussion of delocalized chemical bonding; aldehydes and ketones; amines; carboxylic acids and their derivatives; lipids such as fatty acids and triglycerides; and carbohydrates. The course is a continuation of Organic Chemistry 1 with an emphasis on multifunctional organic compounds, including topics of relevance to biochemistry and biological systems, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, and nucleic acids. The course continues the emphasis on modern analytical methods that are the cornerstone of contemporary organic analysis, with added emphasis on their application to biology and biological chemistry.

            Classical approaches in physical chemistry: equilibrium thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. The definition and the interpretation of some of the most fundamental physical concepts which are used in common "chemistry language" such as internal energy, transition state, chemical potential, reaction rate, phase transition or catalyst, are described in detail. This course uses an extensive mathematical apparatus. It aims at providing chemistry and chemistry-related majors with firm theoretical and practical knowledge that is necessary to resolve typical chemical problems (for instance, in organic chemistry or biochemistry) by focusing on the deeper understanding of their physical foundation and meaning.

           Most of the material in this course is devoted to quantum mechanics, a theory that currently plays a central role in structural chemistry, theoretical chemistry, and spectroscopy. The course provides detailed insight into the modern approaches employed to explain the structure and spectra of atoms and molecules. After completion of this course, students are able to understand the origin and meaning of some contemporary key chemical concepts, including wave function, atomic and molecular orbital, energy level, hybridization, atomic and molecular spectrum, and electron spin. They are also able to interpret various spectra— electronic (ultraviolet/visible), rotational, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance—and to correlate these to the structure of atoms and molecules.

           Biochemistry investigates the chemical structures, reactions and processes that occur in living systems. Indeed, the very principles of chemistry, biology, physics and math converge in the field of biochemistry, and biochemical concepts provide a focal point for many disciplines, including biology, healthcare, the pharmaceutical industry, environmental studies and ecology, and our understanding of evolution. This course opens the study of biochemistry, which continues in Biochemistry 2 with a rigorous investigation of biological macromolecules, including the structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. This then leads to the investigation of enzyme structure, including their mechanism of action and their regulation, moving toward a deep understanding of information flow in cells via detailed biochemical studies of replication, transcription, and translation.

           The capstone seminar series provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascinations of NYUAD scientists and mathematicians.  Through the exposure to NYUAD faculty research students identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth chemistry capstone proposal.  The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.

           The senior capstone experience in chemistry is designed to engage students in a long-term, mentored learning experience that cumulates in a piece of original research and/or scientific theory. The research project focuses on the art of scientific problem-solving through theoretical analysis and/or experimental and technical design. The capstone project provides an opportunity for students to use their knowledge and skills to identify and solve a problem or answer a question in the field of chemistry. The students design and execute a project under the guidance of a faculty mentor. The project culminates in a presentation and a written document of significant length that describes the work in detail.

           This course explores the complexity, strangeness, socio-historical resonance, and expressive power of the human voice, as well as a number of the factors that condition and delimit that power. We begin by discussing that voices relationship to the body (both in terms of anatomy and contemporary discourse on open "embodiment") and to a number of technologies from amplification to auto-tune. In the second half of the course, we focus in on the salience of voice within the experimental music scene in New York. Perhaps most importantly, we treat our classes in experimental vocal collective, composing and performing together throughout the term. No prior musical experience is necessary, but a willingness to make vocal sounds in public is required.
           <span style="line-height:1.6em">
            We examine a number of ways in which the voice has been framed as the result of a complex physiological process; as a quasi-mystical aesthetic object; as a vehicle for communication; as a gendered, racialized, and essentialized text; as a technologically mediated commodity; and as a master trope for identity, human agency, immediacy, and truth. Students read a number of seminal texts on voice; write several focused essays; complete a multimedia project; and, more importantly, use their own voices to make a chorus of sounds in class.

           the portrait as a pivotal human artifact for artistic expression, private identity formation, and public self-fashioning. It traces a series of thematic issues central to the idea of the portrait through history in different cultures, media, and techniques. Themes to study are: image and likeness from antiquity to Facebook; the portrait as real and surrogate presence; portraiture and psychology; the “face of power”; portraits without a face; the work of art as self portrait; digital identity and the private portrait in the public domain; animal portraits and their owners; masks and casts; the unintended portrait; anthropomorphisms and readymades; the better self: face-lift and Photoshop; after life and afterlife.

           Musical instruments have been created by humans for at least 35,000 years. How do diverse musical cultures view the significance of the sounds and playing techniques of musical instruments? From instrumental story-telling in Siberia, Central Asian shaman-bards, dervish flutes, folk, Gypsy and classical fiddling, dulcimers, psalteries and keyboards to drumming in several parts of the world, the course examines why musical cultures need instruments; how these instruments interact with or take the place of vocal music; where they are connected to dance and where they have evolved far from dance; how diverse cultures attribute positive or negative moral values to different instruments and their players; and how a single musical culture may feel the need to exchange, develop or exclude particular musical instruments over time.

           The Garden of Eden haunts the history of the peoples of the Book—Jews, Christians, Muslims—as primal site of creation, bounty, betrayal, and loss, as spur to repentance and redemption, as preview of heaven and model of earthly Utopia. The exile of Adam and Eve from the garden that God planted for the first man and filled with all the Earth's creatures and plants set their descendants on an infinite quest to find, describe, and recreate it. The course studies the efforts by people of the Abrahamic religions to specify the site, form, and meaning of the first Garden, in theology, literature, visual art, film, and garden design. It seeks convergences and differences among these interpretations across millennia and media, and ask whether the Garden of Eden continues to hold productive meanings today. All students participate in a garden design project. This course includes field trips to gardens in Abu Dhabi and abroad.

           This course explores photography’s relationship to language and narrative by examining photography’s rich interactions with literature and film. How do images complement, replace, challenge, or exceed language in narrative works? Can images create alternative forms of narrative? What kind of narratives do photographs generate in fiction? What is the relationship of photography and memory in works of autobiography or of photography and witnessing in social documentary? In what form are such dialogues present in films? We look at a variety of works from around the world which are entirely or almost entirely visual; works in which images and text are combined in creative partnership; and works which are about photographs but in which no images are actually reproduced.

           This course is a practical exploration of collaboration as fundamental creative working method. Taught by a collaborative artist, the course looks at  collaboration as it has emerged from the recent history of art, literature, and science to become an essential method of contemporary social experience. Course projects and materials are based around the use of the iPad. Working with the device on creative, co-authored projects, students gain first-hand experience in considering how collaboration is structured and managed in the production of creative works and how a consideration of collaborative and interactive methods changes the way we think about the nature of the finished creative project.

           This course explores how the mythology, poetics, imagery, and emotion associated with romantic love have varied dramatically over time and in different cultures. Spanning several millennia and many continents, our  material challenges us to think about gender, family, biology, and faith as manifestations of an attempt to reconcile human needs and desires. We work with ancient texts like the Ramayana, the Upanishads, and the Song of Songs; the poetry of Kalidasa, Rumi, and Neruda; plays by Zeami, Euripides, Shakespeare, Lorca, Tennessee Williams, and Sarah Kane; the music of PJ Harvey, Antony &amp; The Johnsons, and Thom Yorke; the photography of Cindy Sherman; and the films of David Lynch. Students move towards creating their own inventions, employing creative writing, physical improvisations, ensemble performance, and photography.

           The scapegoat, however unwillingly, has played a role in human culture since the earliest times. This course examines the phenomena of scapegoating from both a historical and psychological perspective, and examines its treatment in films, literature, music, and new technology. Tracing the origins of scapegoating as a tribal rite and as one of the defining aspects of Greek tragedy, this course ultimately poses the question—what is it, in the human psyche, that causes us to demonize and dehumanize the “other,” and demand, in the most extreme cases, witch trials throughout the centuries, mob lynchings, the Holocaust, and the more recent genocide in Rwanda. This course also touches on the technological forms of scapegoating such as cyber-bullying and examines how the Internet itself is often used as a scapegoating device.

           How does the idea of catastrophe shape artistic studies in the 21st-century? This interdisciplinary course explores catastrophe through a variety of disciplinary thematics. Students use films and literary texts to explore a range of real or fictional disasters. Can catastrophe serve as a lens to understand notions such as the capitalism, globalization, network theory, and ecology?

           What are maps, and what do they tell us? From prehistoric cave paintings to Mercator projection maps to contemporary mobile apps, maps combine the innovation and rigor of art and science. Maps interpret space in and over time. This course examines maps from the ancient and modern worlds, alongside reinterpretations of mapping in paintings, films, video games, and new media, to understand ways that maps produce knowledge visually.

           Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. No computer programming experience is required; the course starts with the basics of code using the Processing environment.

           Underlying performances of all kinds—theatre, dance, music, the performances of everyday life, sports, and popular entertainments—are ritual and play. These must be understood from multiple perspectives. In the course, we investigate roots
           <br/>
           of human ritual and play in animal behavior; human religious and social rituals; and children and adults at play. Examples include the Taziyeh of Shi’a Islam, the Ramlila of Hinduism, the Olympic Games, Noh Drama of Japan, American baseball, “deep” and “dark” play.

           The course will consider the development of and reaction to some of the most transformative of humankind's inventions -- its forms of communication. Through an analysis of the history of image making, writing, printing, photography, the telegraph, radio and television, the course will consider the process through which the uses of such new media are recognized, how they are celebrated and criticized, and what they have made it possible to say and think. In the background, as these histories are analyzed, will be similar questions about the swarm of recent communications technologies loosely known as the Internet. At the end of the course that discussion will move to the foreground.

           Scholarly approaches to Renaissance art have traditionally focused on what it inherited from the Roman world. What happens to our understanding of the Renaissance when we highlight its relationship to Jerusalem, Constantinople, and other cultural centers in the Eastern Mediterranean? This course investigates the interpretive implications of this shift in orientation, exploring the West’s fascination with objects and images produced by Byzantine and Islamic artists, and the complications of identity produced by pilgrimages to the east, both real and imaginary.

           Gesture lies at the interface of the verbal and the non-verbal in human communication and expression. Through bodily movement, intonation, and stress gesture can transcend the distinctions between normal speech, poetry, song, and dance. Gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of gesture in a variety of media across different cultures enables the student to approach fundamental means of human expression, and to learn to recognize constants in human communication within the myriad of culturally specific conventions of language, prosody, music, and dance.

           Inventions have played a pivotal role in the development of history, mankind, and culture. Inventors articulate problems and find creative solutions, often by combining concepts that are not typically linked. This class examines inventions and the process of inventing through case studies. We consider the historical context of inventions and how the use of inventions can change from one culture to another. Some of the inventions we explore are the bow and arrow, the lever, the bicycle, dynamite, the fax machine, and the computer. Students are presented with problems and asked to create prototypes and invent new tools.

           Rhythm has been described as patterns of events in time and space, and is a prominent feature of life and learning. This interdisciplinary course examines what rhythm is and how it manifests itself in a wide variety of domains that range from music and the visual decorative arts traditions spanning cultures across the globe and throughout history, to how it emerges in, and is informed by, areas such as mathematics, computer science, music theory, music technology, biology, psychology, linguistics, sociology, evolution and human migrations, ethnology, crystallography, nuclear physics, calendar design, radio astronomy, architecture, computer graphics, and the visual arts. Students read from books and journal articles, solve problems, listen to music, drum with their hands on their desks, learn how to use computer software systems to analyze as well as generate rhythms, solve puzzles of musical time patterns, and write on a variety of topics. They complete an individual research project that showcases the application of knowledge in their selected discipline and culture to an open question concerned with rhythm. They discuss progress on their projects during the term, and present their results to the class at the end of term. No computer programming experience or musical training is required.

           Of what can we be certain? The course explores the role of doubt throughout history and in various cultures.  It will explore the capacity of doubt to endow human experience and knowledge with complexity and dimension.  While belief can provide the scaffolding of a life, a community, and worldview, doubt has, throughout history, and in every part of the world, wrestled firmly held beliefs toward new invention and discovery creating pivotal moments of scientific, cultural, social and personal development.  The course also focuses on the role of conviction and doubt in storytelling, examining precepts and dramatic principles that employ conviction and doubt toward a greater plurality.  Through our readings and discussion students will examine the role of doubt and conviction in their daily lives.  Close readings of select essays, texts, fables, koans, poetry, novels, plays, short stories and films will serve to map this exploration.  Texts include Plato,

            Timaeus

           <em>

           Desert Odysseys, Dark Continents, Virgin Lands, Harem Fantasies; this interdisciplinary course explores the role of visual culture in shaping our outlook of “other” geographies and cultures as “exotic.” We analyze the role of the diverse technologies in mediating between distant geographies, and making the unknown known. Moving across various texts, arts, media, and institutions – museums, maps, photographs, films, TV programs, and digital spaces – the course reflects on how our imagination of ourselves is intertwined with the ways that we imagine other places. The reading includes: Daniel Defoe,

           This seminar is devoted to the interrelated issues of colonialism, postcolonialism, comparative race, and multiculturalism as apprehended through diverse disciplines, media, and colonial histories. Throughout our focus will be comparative, transnational and transdisciplinary, mingling the theories and methods of media studies, literary studies, philosophy, and social studies. The goal is to reflect in a polycentric way on a multicultural world still shaped by the legacies of (post) colonialism, as reflected, refracted, translated and resisted by the media.

           This course will probe the heuristics of human innovation as understood by ancient and modern inventors and philosophers. The central question of this course are the following, What are the sources, requirements, and factors that influence human ingenuity? Is creativity a gift or a skill? How does creativity differ from innovation? To address these questions, we consider the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; technological innovations that affected the course of human history; and inventions that shape our modern world. Throughout the course, a strong emphasis will be placed on developing a personal philosophy and methodology for creativity.

           Historian Leo Braudy notes that: “the history of fame is also the history of the shifting definition of achievement in the social world.” We will track early discourses of heroism and immortality from Alexander the Great to today’s reality celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Beginning with concepts of fame in antiquity, we investigate Virgil’s The Aeneid, The Bible, Homer's The Odyssey, and Shakespeare’s King Richard III. The rise of contemporary stars across film, television, and theatre raises questions about the ways in which celebrities help manage historically conditioned categories of classification, such as gender, sexuality, race, class and nationality. Case studies of non-Western celebrities, highlight the formatting of modern stardom in Asia (Jackie Chan and Jet Li), Africa (Fela Kuti), and the Middle East (Umm Kulthum).

           This class examines the representation and theorization of the human body as evident in acting theory and performance practices. We will be particularly attentive to the international circulation of ideas of the body. To what extent are the commentaries of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) on Galen and Plato important to Renaissance Europe’s understanding of the performing body? How has Tadashi Suzuki’s interest in Noh, Kabuki, and Ancient Greek theatre informed his collaborations with major figures of the European theatre? Authors will include: Ibn Rushd, Plato, Zeami, Shakespeare, Diderot, Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Brecht, Suzuki.

           This course will consider representations of social and historical realities within which notions of cultural identity, citizenship and power are imagined and presented. Using examples from the performing arts, film and photography, we explore formal technologies of creating representations and cultural modes of interpreting them, and compare how reality is abstracted and codified by representations from different parts of the world. Some of the examples are films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Mother India, Xala and Al Za’eem; plays such as The Road, Al-Malik huwa I-Malik, and St Joan; photographs by Annie Liebovitz, Brian Duffy and Yousef Karsh. Basic semiotic, materialist and reception theories will offer prisms for our study. Key essays such as

           Machines have provided the means for artists to dream different worlds into existence.  Machines impact how we structure our thoughts, our language, and even our bodies. We will examine how writers, visual artists, filmmakers and performers have creatively engaged both obsolete and emerging technologies—mirrors, camera obscuras, phonographs, photocopiers, projectors, telephones, computers, and satellites — to communicate shifts in how we perceive time, movement, space, similarity and difference among human beings, and operations of political power.  We will study a variety of philosophers, scientists, anthropologists, cultural theorists, visual artists and playwrights including Horace, Euripides, Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Michael Taussig, David Hockey, Ingres, Vermeer, Caravaggio, Chuck Close, films by the Lumiere Brothers and Jean Rouch, Apple Computer television commercials, and web-based performance/installation art by Stelarc, Electronic Disturbance Theatre, Emily Jacir, and Ai Weiwei.

           The course explores how image-based representations, written texts, and aspects of the built environment reflect certain conceptions of identity. The course considers paintings, photographs, video, ego documents, and journals. We will focus on artistic practices that examine and/or demonstrate personal or preconceived notions of identity through acts of self-representation. Our questions include: Why do artists from a particular region privilege certain issues over others? What extenuating circumstances may influence an artist's practice? How do artists consider Identity through examination of place? What role does gender or gendered stereotypes play in the production of art? How do artists represent themselves in order to challenge gender or cultural stereotypes?
          </p>
          <p>
           We explore several media and methods of self-representation in artistic practice. Basic visual criticism techniques and theory is introduced in order to understand and differentiate between a wide range of artistic practices and intentions. The course considers artists from the USA, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and includes visits to local galleries and artist studios.

           What is perception and how is it mediated by culture and technology? To what extent do objects of perception look and sound the same across individuals, cultures, and means of representation? How much of music is a function of the way our auditory system works and how much is learned as a part of culture? This class approaches these questions by looking at the scientific literature (to understand the basics of perception), by examining cultural objects such as musical instruments, scales, and performances (for specific examples that bring the ideas into focus) and by contrasting the various technologies for storing and reproducing sound.

           This course analyzes what we understand as “music.” Drawing on music of different styles from all over the world, we will explore what constitutes musical meaning, how it is produced, and how music expresses feelings. Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music. A lab portion of the class guides students through basic musical elements such as notation systems, scales, and simple compositional techniques.

            Lying is an integral part of human communication. It is only in contrast to lies that we are able to construct the concept of truth and “choose” our perception of reality. From white lies and exaggerations to advanced techniques of persuasion such as propaganda and brainwashing, this course will examine the psychological, philosophical, ethical and social aspects of several contexts in which lying commonly occurs: Art, Culture, Literature, Science, Politics, Advertising, Journalism, Relationships, Digital World and History. We will discuss and analyze the motives, techniques, technology and outcomes of some of the biggest lies and liars throughout history, from mythological

           <span>
            gods in ancient Greece through fake alchemists in the Islamic Golden Age to contemporary schemers. We will study examples of lying in texts, films, biographies, cartography, visual arts, internet, social networking, mass media, advertisement as well as guest liars and lying experts.

           Death is a universal fact of human life, powerfully defining the exigencies of our experience. From ancient times until the present, artistic works have registered changing attitudes towards death in the stories they tell. In this seminar, we will examine artistic responses to mortality across a wide range of historical and
           <br/>
           cultural contexts—including in the myths of Orpheus and Osiris, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the text of the Ramayana; the poetry of Darwish, Neruda, and Rilke; stories by Tolstoy, Mishima, and Benjamin; and music of Dowland, Wagner, and Adams. Selected films and plays, including the Noh Drama of Japan, also are considered. Students develop a collaborative or individual artistic project and related critical paper demonstrating their engagement with the topic.

           This course will examine the representation of personal experience in its biographical and autobiographical forms in the arts with a focus on performance. We pay particular attention to the ways in which personhood is aesthetically, psychologically, and politically theorized in different contexts. What does an individual’s experience represent in specific art works? How is the relationship of individual experience to collective experience reconstructed in different arts works? Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist’s oeuvre in relation to their personal life? In what ways do individual art works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities? Texts for the course include works by Irving Goffman, Errol Morris, Erik Erikson, Joseph Roach, Freddie Rokem, Deirdre Heddon, and selected plays, films and museum displays.

           Memory is a dynamic process influenced by internal and external factors. Internally, a person’s individual memory content is overwritten each and every time something is remembered. Externally, memory is determined by social practices and, not least, our physical environment, shaping what may be called social or collective memory. The stability of the physical environment is a guarantor of an individual’s memory and, by implication, identity, to a much greater extent than individual memory itself; it was as early as 2000 years ago that the nexus of the urban space and a stable memory was established (Cicero, Quintilian). The class will focus on theoretical concepts of memory in the fields of the arts, technology and invention in antiquity and the 20th century (Warburg, Halbwachs, Nora), discuss a novel that satirically memorises the fall of the Wall (Brussig) and provide numerous field trips that exemplify the concepts of social/collective memory based upon the urban space of Berlin (the replacement of the GDR Palace of the Republic by a reconstructed City Palace, Holocaust Memorial, Sinti and Roma Memorial, Jewish Museum, book burning memorial, Berlin Wall, Berlin Museums, the 3rd Reich Germania project).

           We are habituated to think of tools as physical objects that facilitate utilitarian actions. Pencils, glassware, and hammers are tools of this type. However, the definition of a tool can be expanded beyond material objects, to include things like storytelling and the internet. Tools can facilitate interpersonal interactions and enable intimate communication, yet have no physical manifestation. This course studies the invention and use of tools across cultures and time. We examine a large number of examples, starting with languages, moving through tools like the wheel and metalwork to modern tools like software and network topologies, asking how our choice of tools changes the way we think about our goals.

           What drives us to create records of human events or experience? And how has that drive shaped not only the history of human communication but of record-keeping itself? What is the relationship between an event and the records or recordings we make of it? Is there tension between the promise of mimetic or documentary fidelity and new possibilities for art and imagination? When is the memorializing goal better served by invention than recording? This course will examine a series of technological innovations in record-keeping and record-making, from cuneiform to cassette culture, mp3s, and beyond. Readings will address histories and theories of orality and literacy, archives, print, photography, film, sound recording, and other media as we explore fundamental questions about memory, history, technology, and the relationship between art and life.

           What can the unique human ecology and worldview that emerges from mobile ways of life teach us about human ingenuity and culture? This course uses the lenses of philosophy, art, and design to examine the history, influence, and cultural underpinnings of nomadism and nomadic dwelling. Paying special attention to kinetic objects and the built environment, we will probe historical and contemporary conceptions of ownership and ecology, transience and permanence, home and homelessness, and citizenship and belonging. We will study writings by Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, and Rosi Braidotti, artworks by Andrea Zittel, Lucy Orta, and Krzysztof Wodiczko and cinematic works including Lawrence of Arabia and Dances with Wolves. All aspects of mobile dwellings, from familiar vernacular models such as tents and huts to developments in humanitarian design and contemporary art, will be considered. Students will be presented with a series of design challenges and will be asked to solve problems by creating new designs and producing prototypes. No previous background or training in design is required.

           While Aristotle celebrated the capacity of art to elicit emotion, Plato treated it with suspicion. Suspected of irrationality, emotion has continued to hold a contested position in the understanding of art. This course will explore the ways that art both expresses and arouses the emotions and to what value and ends. It asks how stories engage us in prototypical, emotional human situations such as suffering, separation, loss, recognition and reunion. We will think about what aspects of our emotional responses are universal, what are culturally specific, what are gendered, what are individual and personal, and the similarities and differences between art emotions and actual emotions. We will draw on a wide range of artworks from a variety of periods and cultures as case studies, including visual and narrative representations of the Passion of Christ; canonical love stories, like Laila Majnun and Romeo and Juliet; classical and modern tragedy; romantic, popular, and program music; and comic art like The Comedy of Errors and silent film comedy. These studies will be framed by the theories of, among others, Aristotle, Abhinavagupta, Tolstoy, Langer, Bergson, Freud, analytic philosophy (Carroll, Kivy), and cognitive theory (Hogan).

           What is war?  Why do wars exist? What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present.  The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the  laments  and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict.  Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso,  Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among  others.

           This course explores the multifaceted nature of time, in different historical, social and religious contexts.  We will pursue three main strands: 1) changing conceptions of time, time-keeping systems, and states of time consciousness from antiquity to the present; 2) representations of time in works of art that heighten our apprehension of time and its vertiginous quality or aim to escape the rule of time and induce a quality of timeless suspension; and 3) the technologies of time-keeping from sundials to atomic watches, calendars to timelines.  Denaturalizing our own conventions of keeping time, we will consider the purposes of time measurement, the history of the hour, the development of the mechanical clock and its impact on society, the relationship between clock time and industrialization, the shift from local to international standard time, and the question whether the human experience of time is common across cultures or is culturally specific and variable.

An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques.  The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.

           Telling stories is a fundamental human activity, but the ways these stories are told depends upon the means in which they are created and transmitted.  This course examines the role of technologies ranging from print, cave painting, comics, animation, and film, to hypertext, social media, and viral video.  In addition to reading and viewing, the assignments will also include creative technological projects and excursions to the Museum of Moving Image, the Museum of Comics Art, and The Moth storytelling theater.

           This course explores ways of listening, and of being a listener, in human experience, with attention to the role of the ear in the constitution of subjects, communities, and societies of different times and places. Topics include debates about the listening subject in Western philosophy and media studies; the role of the ‘ethnographic ear’ in cultural anthropology and ethnomusicology; theories and methods of ‘soundscape research’ and ‘acoustemology’; and aurality as an aspect of culture, explored through case studies ranging from the development of sound reproduction technologies, to deaf culture, to the ethics of sounding and listening in religious practice. Course readings, drawn from a wide range of disciplines, include foundational texts in the emerging interdisciplinary field of ‘sound studies’. In addition to engaging critically with a range of ideas and debates through discussion, presentations, and writing, students will try their ears at specialized modes of training and data collection developed by sound-oriented researchers and artists.

           This seminar concerns the phenomenon of vision. The sense of vision is closely related to processes of understanding, thought, and linguistic interpretation. Seeing is an activity in which the eye and brain work together, but the imagination also affects vision, for we sometimes imagine what we say we see. We will study the connection of image and language using the example of Hollis Frampton’s film Nostalgia, which suggests that vision entails an aspect of imagining. We will approach questions about the nature of vision on the basis of texts, cinematic materials, art works, and experiments we conduct. The texts on which we will work include “classical” ones by authors such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, but also more recent theoretical approaches by Serge Daney, for example. We will also focus on the phenomenon of synaesthesia as it is emphasized as ‘haptic seeing’ in the work of Lygia Clark.

           What motivates human beings to form collections? How do we select, order, preserve and display information and objects? And, what intellectual processes are involved in these activities? What does the content of these collections say about those who created them? And, what kind of narratives can be traced within the display of these collections? This course surveys the phenomenon of collecting, focusing on key moments in its history, from antiquity up to contemporary times.  In the first section of the class, we explore collections of  “thought,” that is, how knowledge has been stored, organized and retrieved – and some of the tools we have developed to do so – including mnemonic devices, writing, codices, libraries, information architecture and digital technologies. The second section concerns physical objects, and their collection, classification, organization, and display. Finally, we discuss the work of modern and contemporary artists who incorporate concepts of assemblage and curation. In response to the readings and to the materials covered in class, students will conceive, create, describe and display a collection of their own making.

           This course asks how objects from the past obtain meaning long after they were made, and how they have come to express the identity of communities, nations, and religions. We will consider fundamental questions of identity by assessing how objects become imbued with meaning.  Who ascribes these objects meaning and why?  How do we relate to objects designated to represent us?  We will explore object biographies from a range of periods, regions and traditions.  We will discuss objects representing contested national and global identities, such as the Cyrus Cylinder from Iraq, and the Koh-i-noor diamond from India, as well as material that facilitates discussion of socially and culturally defined identities.  In all of these examples politics plays a constant role.  Through case studies of iconic objects from around the world, we will compare significance in the originating society with place and function today to better understand how, why, and by whom identity is constructed.

           While seemingly inhospitable to life, the desert teems with animals and plants that have evolved to cope with an arid environment. This course addresses fundamental questions related to desert climates and the species that populate them. What geographic conditions generate a desert terrain? How rapidly does the terrain change over time? What are the special attributes of the plants and animals that thrive in desert climates, and how do these populations change as the desert changes? This course uses the local terrain as a laboratory to address these questions, and team projects requiring field work form the core of the learning experience.

           Why is Earth the only object in the solar system with obvious signs of life? How did the building blocks of life form on Earth? What is the likelihood that there are other forms of life out there? This course addresses these questions and more, by covering the chemical evolution of the Universe, the formation of our solar system, the search for and study of extra-solar planets, and the possible cosmological implications of life’s existence.

           I want to live forever! Since antiquity, humans have confronted physical immortality in song, literature, theater, and science. Indeed, the alchemists sought an elixir of life with curative powers that would prolong indefinitely the lives of those who consumed it. And even as alchemy gave way to chemistry, and science evolved into a modern discipline that focuses on understanding the natural world through strict rules of experimentation, the notion of immortality did not disappear. In fact, biologists often asked—and continue to ask—the related question: Why must we die? The results are often surprising. This course examines immortality and, by necessity, death, principally from the view of science, but also using literature and film. In doing so, fundamental human concerns are confronted—birth, growth, aging, sickness, and death—as the course explores immortality and the human desire to live forever.

           While the 20th century has often been characterized as the Century of Physics, many have already named the 21st century as the Century of Genetics. Important markers highlight the speed and drama of the molecular genetic revolution. These include the technique of somatic nuclear cell transfer (with the realization of mammalian cloning and the specter of human cloning) and germ-line gene therapy (with its specter of altering the genetic makeup of future generations). Alongside these markers is the promise of stem cell cures for many human ailments and diseases, and DNA identification technology to exonerate the innocent and convict the guilty. But this is only the beginning, since the newest developments promise to go far beyond “cure” to delve into human “enhancements” of mental acuity and physical prowess. This course examines these and other developments, lodging the heated debates that each generates in both social and cultural histories and current incarnations.

           We often don’t know for sure whether something will happen (or has happened). Probability provides a way of thinking about the uncertain. We look at the fundamentals of the mathematics of probability, including such important results as the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. We study the inferences that one should make, and the decisions that one should take, when the evidence leaves it uncertain what is true. We also examine some of the foundational philosophical issues about the concept of probability—is it something objective or subjective? And does genuine randomness exist in the world?

          <p>
           At the beginning of the 20th century, a scientific revolution started that was destined to change radically the way we think about the physical world. Einstein’s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public’s everyday experiences and intuition. Challenging that notion of inaccessibility, this course analyzes some of the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory.

           What is the current state of Earth in terms of human well-being and human impact on Earth’s natural systems? Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world's lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.

           This course provides a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of programming, which is the foundation of Computer Science. It is intended as a first course for students from different disciplines; no prerequisite is needed. Programming has revolutionized every aspect of our lives from art and other media to education, business, and the core sciences. Students learn the basics of how computers “think” and how computer programs (software applications) are created. We develop simple and fun applications involving graphics, sound, text processing, animation, basic interactive game techniques, networking, and web interfaces. Students produce short programs and one final project using Python, a  relatively easy programming language with powerful visual and graphics capabilities.

           The very word “mutations” tends to raise fear and apprehension since it is so often associated with physical deformities or exposure to harmful agents, including radiation. Perhaps such fear is warranted since many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cancer, are caused by “mutations”, which are mere changes in the genetic information in DNA. Starting with basic concepts, this course explores important cellular macromolecules, such as DNA, and proteins as well as their three-dimensional structures that endow them with their specific functions. In fact, understanding how mutations induce alterations to  macromolecular structures often sheds light on the characteristic symptoms and prognoses of some human diseases and syndromes. Laboratory projects, which focus on introduction to computer modeling, emphasize visualizing in a three-dimensional environment the normal and altered macromolecules associated with some common but complex human maladies.

           This course probes the heuristics of human innovation in the ancient world. We study the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; ponder the methods that might have been used in the construction of monolithic structures such as Stone Henge, Egyptian obelisks, and pyramids; and explore examples of technological innovations that affected the course of human history. Throughout the course, the emphasis is on developing personal approaches to creativity and innovation by studying specific examples of these attributes from the ancient world.

           Microbes are tiny organisms that are found on every imaginable surface and habitat. This complex myriad can consist of microbes that are essential to a healthy life, as well as microbes that cause infectious diseases in plants and animals, which may also contribute to many chronic diseases and conditions, such as cancer and environmentally-related diseases. To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.

           Microbes are tiny organisms that are found on every imaginable surface and habitat. This complex myriad can consist of microbes that are essential to a healthy life, as well as microbes that cause infectious diseases in plants and animals, which may also contribute to many chronic diseases and conditions, such as cancer and environmentally-related diseases. To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.

           Over half of the human population lives within 100km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the worlds largest cities. As a result, the world's natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to explain the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globaly and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.

           Knowing the three-dimensional structure of a molecule is important for understanding its functional properties. Is it indeed possible to visually analyze a molecule and use the observed experimental data to build a three-dimensional model? This structural information can be obtained using a variety of analytical techniques such as X-ray crystallography, and can lead to significant breakthroughs in pharmaceutics. Students grow crystals of different colors, shapes, and sizes and harvest them for physical and morphological  characterization in order to understand the basic principles of atomic structure and theory, chemical bonding and reactions, thermochemistry, periodicity, and solution chemistry.

           Will genetic manipulation ever improve our well-being? When the gene was discovered and our ability to manipulate it became apparent, a whole new era in science began. Scientists wanted to understand the power that hides in the gene and the effects of its manipulation. The Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003 led to the identification of the genes in the Human DNA. This discovery is now leading the way to trying to understand the roles of those genes in our bodies, the diseases that may result from their malfunctioning, and consequently treating those diseases at the gene level. This growing field is known as Gene Therapy. In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy. This course travels through the world of genetics and examines the Human Genome Project, successful stories and challenges in the field of Gene Therapy, Genetically Modified Foods, and Cloning; all being topics that have fundamental implications on the society that will live in and contribute towards.

           E=mc2: One simple equation encapsulates the power to grant life and death in equal measure. Life associated with fusion in the sun, radiation therapy, and nuclear energy; death via nuclear bombs and nuclear disasters. This course uses nuclear physics as a prism for exploring science as a human endeavor, focusing on the physics of the atomic nucleus and its technological applications. Arguments for and against nuclear power plants are analyzed, while the power and threat of nuclear weapons are assessed. The international treaties designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons are scrutinized, emphasizing the challenges that lawmakers and citizens face in determining and guiding the uses of nuclear power as we grapple with the moral responsibility that all of us—scientists, politicians, and citizens—must bear for ourselves, our nations, and ultimately, for humanity.

           In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale “The Three Princes of Serendip,” whose heroes “were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.” In the ensuing centuries, the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improve our standard of living.

           Cyberspace is playing an increasing role in our lives, and our society is rapidly becoming structured around the 24/7 availability and trustworthiness of information systems. We already entrust cyberspace with our privacy, national security, physical safety, and digital identities.
           <span>
           </span>
           Maintaining an orderly, peaceful, safe, and productive society will increasingly depend on maintaining trust in information systems. However, trust cannot be realized by technology alone.
           <span>
           </span>
           This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is essentially a social system that relies on important technical components.
           <span>
           </span>
           The course will begin with a discussion of trust, risk and deception as developed in the social sciences and examine how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. In the second part of the course we will examine the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms that have been developed to create trustworthy systems.
           <span>
           </span>
           In the third and final part of the course we will examine the interplay between the technical and social aspects and see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar and cyberterrorism. A computer science or engineering knowledge is not necessary for taking this course.

           Before Copernicus, the earth was regarded as the stable center of the universe. Coming to accept the earth’s rotation and motion around the sun was one of science’s greatest shocks to humanity’s understanding of our place in the order of things. We investigate the structure of the theories that preceded Copernicus, and the various sorts of arguments—empirical, conceptual, and even religious—that were made for and against his account. Our aim is to appreciate how scientific theories of the world are constructed, criticized and defended. Texts include relevant parts of Aristotle and Ptolemy, Galileo’s

           Many problems in science, business, and politics require heuristics -- problem solving techniques that often work well even if not perfectly. This course teaches heuristics as they have applied in the design of scientific experiments, the solution of problems global power politics, and in the resolution of economic negotiations. While being exposed to heuristic techniques, students work in small teams that compete with one another to design strategies to solve new puzzles better than other teams. You are given computational tools as needed, but the course has no programming prerequisite. To take this course, you should love to think both qualitatively and quantitatively.  Among the specific problems we will tackle include the design of currencies, leasing strategies for oil exploration, optimal matchmaking, and efficient experimental design. The intent is to make you better able to face complex problems in any field you choose.

           Over 80% of the Australian population lives within 100 km of a coast and virtually all major Australian cities occur on coastlines. As a result, Australia's coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of Sydney, Australia's largest city, as a case study to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas worldwide. Using Sydney's terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a natural laboratory for field research, students will collect environmental data throughout the city and use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine the spatial patterns of human impacts to Sydney's environment and to compare their results with patterns observed in other coastal cities.

           What we consider modern human society represents a tiny and very peculiar blip in the very long history of human beings on this planet. Whether we consider the 10,000 year history of settled civilization, the 200,000 year history of anatomically modern humans, or the 6 million year history of “proto-humans” since our divergence from our closest species relatives, to fully understand human society is to consider the incredible journey that has led our species to where we are now. Through an investigation of art, archaeology, psychology, anthropology, and deep history, and with the use of films, myths and scientific research, we explore this epic journey and the legacy that it has left on humanity.

           Tropical Africa conjures up thoughts of high biodiversity and relatively low economic development. We will use a course sited in Africa to study the major principles of biodiversity, such as ecology, biochemical cycles, wildlife population dynamics, and conservation. We also look at human impacts on biodiversity, as affected by economic well-being, through production of energy, food, water, and pollution.

           When is it legitimate to conclude that A causes B? In human history, causality was sometimes the province of the gods as in there is lightening because a god is throwing bolts at the earth. The introduction of Aristotelian logic permitted the development of deductive logic and the notion of consistency. Because deduction manipulates knowledge but does not add to it, natural science uses induction in which universal causal laws are believed because of experiments at a few times and places. This course begins with a discussion of the history of the arguments for causality, then it embarks on a detailed discussion of certain great experiments and the conclusions that resulted. In the process, we discuss how the progress of science determines what is accepted as a cause, from the "taint" of an ancestral line to the psychological impacts of childhood. Next, we discuss the inference of causality by machine. Students will work on projects involving the construction of experiments (either ones we have discussed or others), the discovery of the laws of a simulated world that the instructor has created, and then playing a game in that world.

           This course explores the perennial question, how does the mind work? We learn how philosophers, computer scientists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and linguists have answered this question. We consider several stimulating but demanding questions about the nature of the mind and try to understand how the mind enables such things as perception, thinking, and behavior. We review the historical and scientific developments the lead to the contemporary consensus that the human mind is fundamentally a computational organ and explores some of the challenges that this view poses to our common sense understanding of certain attributes, like consciousness and free will, that ascribe to ourselves as human beings.

           This course considers the origins of science in ancient cosmologies. What principles are preserved? Considering the classical Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, the question of how and to what extent culture determines the paradigms of science is investigated. We begin with formative texts from the Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, including the Rig Veda, the Upanishads (India), the I Jing, Dao De Jing, and the neo-Confucian synthesis (China) and the pre-Socratic Ionian physicists (Western), then turn to the development of modern science.  Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read in parallel with seminal texts describing the rise of modern science in China and India. The course will conclude with a survey of contemporary cosmological theories to see how some ancient ideas are retained in modern science.

           This course examines the Earth's climate and in particular how it evolved in the past and is likely to change in the future. We first consider weather patterns around the globe and ask whether the occurrence of “weird weather” corresponds to the emergence of worldwide disruption. Then we study physical processes, such as radiation, clouds, and wind, that are at the core of both weather and climate, and discuss how human activities can affect them. Finally, we use this understanding to consider predictions of future climate change,

           Daily experience attests that the briefest of glances at other people often suffices to furnish a wealth of socially relevant information about them. From minimal visual cues, for instance, we can infer group memberships (e.g., sex and age), emotional states, personality traits, and even a person’s intentions. The dexterity with which humans deduce such knowledge has fascinated ancient philosophers and contemporary thinkers alike. As a result, much thought has been dedicated towards a process that typically unfolds within less than a second. Based on this work, films, literary texts, and scientific evidence are presented to explore the perceptual, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that underlie common snap judgments in person evaluation. The accuracy of these judgments, their neural foundation, and the societal consequences of rapidly assessing others are discussed.

           In 300 BC, Euclid first described Vision as the process by which rays traveled in a straight line from the eye to the object seen. Since ancient times, our curiosity about vision has propelled the invention of tools to enlarge information that could not be perceived with the naked eye and to make sense of the world around us. This course explores the development of optics and its influence on visual communication. How has our understanding of vision been communicated and changed over time? How successful have we been in “visualizing” the visual network that we are concurrently studying and trying to decipher? As we shed light on the visual code, we will highlight the importance of visualization tools in advancing scientific research. Has film informed or misinformed the science of visual perception and is there such a thing as the "objective eye?"

           “In the year of 1657 I discovered very small living creatures in rain water.” This quote is attributed to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch merchant whose skillful use of glass lenses allowed him to peer into a world of microorganisms that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. His careful observations gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed
           <br/>
           structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. A special emphasis will be placed on capturing images of seven wonders of the invisible world - natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins and naturally-occurring crystals.

           This course will examine views of light throughout human history. Topics include: classical optics to understand how the rainbow works; pre-modern theories of light and the 300-year battle between its particle and wave nature; how photographers capture and measure light; the relationship of polarization phenomena to the ideals of the French revolution; the effect of new tools for seeing, such as x-ray and electron imaging, on light in photography and modern painting; and the uses of luminescence in molecular biology and genetically engineered works of art. Ultimately, we wrestle with the “entanglement” of photons and what this reveals about the nature of light and our universe.

           Works of art, like all objects, absorb, emit and reflect light at specific wavelengths. This gives every object its own unique pattern, known as its spectral signature. Imaging spectroscopy enables us to image these spectral signatures, and the subsequent processing of these images allows the analysis and identification of materials to take place without the need to sample the object. Imaging spectroscopy was developed for the remote sensing of the Earth and more recently Mars, and has in the last decade been applied to the study of works of art in ways not before possible. In this short course students will be introduced by a leading imaging scientist to imaging spectroscopy, and will apply it to study the materials and working methods of medieval and Renaissance painters.  Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of the scientific method by examination of several paintings in the Acton Collection at NYU-Florence, Villa la Pietra, will learn about how scientists and conservators work together to interpret the resulting data, and will expand their knowledge of the history of art and artists' materials.

           Underlying the order of natural systems and the simple rules they would appear to follow, is complexity born from the large number of objects under consideration and the functional connections between these objects at hierarchies of scale. The science of complexity, and goal of this course, concerns how to model such systems as connected networks so that we may understand better how the objects of disparate systems become self-organized, robust to disruption, and connected by links that increase in number/length according to common mathematical power laws. Topics for discussion are drawn from physical (e.g., geology, astronomy), biological (e.g., ecology, medicine), and social (e.g., economy, communications) systems. A consideration of the complexity of our own neural network, evincing conscious and unconscious benefits and hindrances to our behavior, will highlight an appreciation for the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon we call creativity, which characterizes our search for new unknowns in science.

           Proteins and organic compounds came together over three billion years ago to form the first cell. However, we have only been able to see cells for approximately 300 years through the microscope. In the early days of cellular imaging, the cell body was figuratively represented as buzzing cities or mythological realms. Today, the power of electron microscopy and animation reveal more details about the inner life of cells than ever before, and yet subjective and singular interpretations of the cell have persisted. This course explores cellular identity in the context of visual imagery and advances in visualization. Students will express their own ideas of the cell by creating original short films.

           This course offers students an introduction to the key principles and practices of public health using four epidemics as learning tools: the eradication of smallpox, the AIDs epidemic, polio eradication efforts and the global epidemic of tobacco use. These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco).  The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic's scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health.

           Science is fundamentally about exploring the unknown, and a major part of being a scientist is learning how to handle uncertainty. Statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, the range of validity of models, approximations, data outliers, competing interpretations: scientists spend most of their time wrestling with these problems. Unfortunately, in classrooms and in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. If uncertainty is acknowledged, it is often portrayed as an argument between two groups of experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well established facts, and scientists occasionally have clear-cut divisions of opinion, more commonly they have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about the significance of a particular measurement or study. In this class, we familiarize ourselves with the language of probability and statistics, explore how it developed historically to become central to the scientific process, and how it is used by different scientific disciplines. We discuss how scientists express their ignorance, and how individuals and policy makers can still make judgments based on incomplete scientific knowledge. We also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs. Finally, we discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, we can still put limits on our uncertainty.

           Why we behave in a certain way is one of the most fascinating and complex questions and one that we often cannot even explain to ourselves. So what drives behavior? How can behavior be measured? And can behavior be changed? This course will examine behavior from the viewpoints of biology, neuroscience, economics, psychology and philosophy. We will place an emphasis on interpreting and designing experiments that measure behavior in both humans and animals. We will discuss topics as diverse as memory, morality and altruism and examine how being part of small and large groups can affect decision-making and behavior.

           Numbers pervade our lives, so it may seem self-evident what they are. But like languages, technologies or ideologies, numbers have a history, and understanding of them has changed over time and also been surprisingly controversial.  Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers.  Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality.  Reading these authors will help us understand why even today’s science has no definitive answer to the apparently simple question about its faithful servants: what is a number?

           Science is a social enterprise, although one traditionally thought to be grounded in facts and reason. Scientists collaborate with each other, undermine one another, and compete for funding of research. Whether a scientific idea ever sees the light of day may depend on these distinctly social factors. So how much of what we call ‘scientific progress’ is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates—the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? We'll examine this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. Our starting point will be Thomas Kuhn’s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, we’ll consider why many scientific revolutions occurred in Europe and not elsewhere. Are some cultural and social features more hospitable than others to scientific inquiry?

           Our guiding question emerges from the story of Babel:  why are there many languages?  Should we view linguistic diversity on par with superficial cultural differences, as reflecting essential differences in modes of thinking, or as products of incommensurate world views?  This question will be explored across disciplines, from the philosophical discussion of the (im)possibility of translation, through the literary theoretic debate about the connection between speech and writing, to recent discussions in psychology and anthropology about linguistic determinism (language determining thought or culture determining language).  These debates across intellectual traditions center around the key question of the source of linguistic universals:  do commonalities among languages reflect an innate brain "organ" or do they reflect commonalities in human culture and in general human cognitive capabilities.  The linguist’s argument for an innate universal grammar invites us to view language history in biblical terms, as the cultural fall from a single original language, fixed by biology, but such biological determinism is also consistent with the idea that the multi-lingual cosmopolitan human has always been our natural state.

           This course asks what temperature reveals about the past and future of our species, planet and universe. Scientific measurements of temperature only began in the 17th century and the meaning of temperature was not fully understood until the 19th century. We will examine how that understanding developed and how temperature came to provide a key ingredient in the scientific toolbox. Its study will be used as a unifying guide to examine a wide range of phenomena in our natural world, from the cooling of the Universe in the first minutes of its expansion after the Big Bang to the role that temperature fluctuations have played in the Earth’s history and the threats posed by global warming. Biological adaptations to different degrees of hot and cold will be examined through the action of heat and cold loving bacteria and through the techniques mammals have adopted for temperature regulation. Readings will be in the history of science and in both primary and secondary sources in physics, astronomy, biology and geology.

           Big Data is the science of large data sets. These sets have appeared in rising volume, variety and velocity during the last decade. The rise of big data is due chiefly to data collection via social networks, E-commerce and web navigation, but other types of data collection, related to phones, medicine or world trade are also involved. How do we get relevant information from these large data sets? For example, based on a very accurate analysis of their own collected data sets, companies as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Netflix manage to get significant hints about what should interest specific customers. Data analysis is also becoming more important in healthcare with personalized medicine. This course takes a cross-disciplinary approach to Big Data, beginning with the sources and applications of Big Data, such as business, genomics, economics, and sociology. Then, we will look at how statistics and computer science (via machine learning) aid the analysis of data sets.

           How does science develop and change? What sorts of considerations are used to assess and evaluate scientific theories, particularly when those theories upend our entire picture of the physical world and our place in it? Are there factors that go beyond the empirical data itself, such as broader conceptual and religious considerations? And are these ‘extra-empirical’ considerations legitimate constraints on scientific inquiry? This course will examine these big questions about the nature of science in the context of Galileo’s groundbreaking theory on the nature of motion—a theory that laid the groundwork for Newton and the rise of modern science. We will look at the many conflicts in which Galileo became embroiled—scientific, religious, and personal—and study the historical developments that eventually led to widespread acceptance of the Galilean worldview. Our aim will be to understand the complicated way in which Galileo’s physics emerged, was resisted, and eventually triumphed, and to situate that evolution within a broader narrative about the nature of scientific development and change.

           Today, the cost of human genotyping is dropping faster than Moore’s law is bringing down the price of computer chips.  Individuals are genotyping themselves in record numbers using consumer services like 23andme.  Emerging from these data, new research on the role of genes in our lives and in society often yields counterintuitive results.  For example, it turns out that while genes matter for both IQ and social class, they are just as much an engine of social mobility as they are of class reproduction.  Meanwhile, a deeper look at race shows that genetic analysis does not reify our racial categories but instead destroys them.  This course will explore this emerging field of socio-genomics. New York City and Abu Dhabi are cosmopolitan centers that draw immigrants from all over the world.  What can and can’t the genetic make-up of their respective populations tell us about their pasts and their futures?

           How does nature serve as a model for the design of synthetic materials? Biomimetics is defined as the structure and function of biological systems as models for the design and engineering of materials.This introductory course reviews the complexities in natural materials following millions of years of evolution and how efficient they are in comparison to  standard engineering materials in performing specific tasks.  The course  will also present students with the basic concepts of engineering  materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors) and their structure/property relationship and how current manufacturing techniques  inspire scientists to recreate nature-like structures to improve current engineering practice.  The course is geared to the classroom and  experimental laboratory setting where students manipulate materials and  explore material properties for biomimetic design.

           Different cultures have both unique and common properties.  These can be linguistic properties, properties of politeness, of government, of art, of economics, of food, of gender relationships, and even of war. Tools for cross-cultural comparison should allow those who are familiar with only a few cultures to enter properties and values about those cultures and then allow searchers to compare the cultures in various ways. For example, it should be possible to discover the commonalities and differences among pairs of cultures, to cluster many cultures based on their commonalities, and to find cultural rules of the form "if culture has property x, then it has property y".  This course will begin with the discussion of a key cultural notion-- language. You will learn the basics of linguistics and then will interact with a cross-cultural database and analysis platform called Terraling. We will also study data sets that may be useful for cross-cultural analysis mostly from the social sciences, anthropology, and archaeology.  After that, you will engage in projects to use Terraling to enter other properties and values about a topic of your choice (e.g. about food, legal structure etc.). Some of that data will come from the data sets others have gathered that are on the web and some will come from data that you yourselves gather. In the process you will learn elements of statistics, machine learning, programming in Python, and experimental design and evaluation.

           Mathematics takes its problems from the real world and puts order into chaos. It sometimes strongly challenges common sense and produces extraordinary dreams of human history.  The course concerns questions and concepts from various areas in mathematics, in particular number theory: the ``alarm clock numbers'' and some of their applications (for example to music) ; irrational numbers and their intimate links with art and geometry as well as the scandal raised by their discovery in ancient Greece ; the Golden Ratio with its surprising mathematical properties, its connections with biology through Fibonacci sequences and art history; prime numbers and their chaos, order and mystery ; the fantastic number π, some of its properties, and messy and beautiful formulae to approach it ; continued fractions, the sum of two-squares theorem ; the five (or three) Platonic solids from prehistory to modern times ; some amazing paradoxes raised by probabilities ; and Poincaré finite-infinite universe. Through these and other examples we will consider how and why mathematics is a subversive intellectual activity, relying on passion, imagination, and beauty as much as on logic and rigorous argumentation.

           How have diseases, and efforts to control them, shaped the nature and course of Gulf societies?  This course explores this core question by considering disease as a product of complex intersections between the natural and social worlds and local and global forces.  Topics to be discussed include: malaria, agriculture, drainage, and war in the Tigris-Euphrates marshlands; respiratory and sexually transmitted diseases, trade, pilgrimage, and quarantine in Hormuz, Mecca, and Dubai; hunger, offerings, and therapeutics in Persian shrines, mosques, and hospitals; pesticides, food production, diabetes, and the kidney market in India and the UAE; infertility, Islam, assisted reproduction, and medical tourism in Egypt and the Gulf states; and oil, migrant labor, Gulf sovereign funds, and the WHO polio eradication campaign.  Readings come from history, anthropology, sociology, and literature.

           For centuries The 1001 Nights (or Arabian Nights) has served as a point of encounter between Middle Eastern literary traditions and the cultural politics of Western literary and artistic production and translation. This course examines the much-debated history of the Nights and the cross-cultural exchange that has seen the tales adapted for distinct audiences in medieval Egypt and Syria, modern Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.

           This course focuses on questions of religious and cultural difference through the 1001 Nights and related texts. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and ‘pagan’ realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah’s Cosmopolitanism and Said’s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland’s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

           Across all cultures, stories are fashioned to withhold information at first, holding our attention through suspense. They then produce disclosures at crucial moments of denouement. For Aristotle, this dynamic movement from ignorance to knowledge is essential, especially when it takes the form of the discovery—or recognition—of previously unknown identity. Tracing an arc from the ancient world to the present day, students study how the epistemology of modern storytelling across cultures disturbs the familiar patterns of clear and comforting revelation associated with classic genres. Readings include: Aristotle’s Poetics; Oedipus Rex; the Odyssey; the Old Testament; the Gospels of Mark and John; the Qur’an; the Arabian Nights; Shakespeare’s King Lear; Naguib Mahfouz; and films from the 1940s to the present.

           The search for knowledge has been linked historically to the traveler’s experience of new places and peoples. Travel necessitates the creation of translations that reveal how knowledge of otherness necessarily involves comparison to home and self. Drawing on texts that represent travel in realistic, figurative, and fantastic terms, we explore the idea that a journey entails the discovery, not only of a destination, but also of the self. As Rilke wrote, “There is only one journey. Going inside yourself.”

           For the first time in human history, the weather is about us.  Growing scientific evidence of catastrophic—and anthropogenic— climate change brings new urgency to an old question: how do we humans conceive of our relationship to “nature”? This course explores how imaginative writers have situated the human in relation to Earth’s many landscapes, plants, climates, and species. How have they depicted meaningful encounters between humans and the other animals? What have they suggested about humans’ responsibilities to the countless other living beings with whom we share this planet? How have they “mapped” the slippery and shifting conceptual ground that lies between the “man-made” and the “natural”? And how might a renewed engagement with this vast theme help us deal with the heavy weather ahead? Readings include Gilgamesh, Genesis, Bacchae, Narrow Road to the North, Walden, Island of Dr. Moreau, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Life of Pi.

           The world seems to be pervaded by ghosts: the narratives of demons or devilish illusions and the spirits of the dead are omnipresent. Indeed all human civilizations appear to have constructed an immaterial world inhabited by spiritual beings and vapors. Consequently, one can find extensive narratives and visualizations of ghosts in word and image up to our present day. The course will follow up a wide range of texts, pictures and films from antiquity to the present day, including Homer, Plato, the Bible, Shakespeare, Hobbes, Kant, Thomas Mann, the Arabian Nights, the Tale of Genji and various Chinese sources.

           Cities hold a special fascination for writers as the most complex form of social organization. This course investigates the various ways in which writers have represented the dynamics of city life. Topics to be investigated include the use
           <br/>
           of cities as philosophical points of departure by such thinkers as Plato and St. Augustine; the development of mnemonics as a response to the challenges of urban space; the decline in representations of the city during the European Middle Ages; the inescapability of the city in post-Enlightenment Western Literature; and the depiction of cities in non-Western texts and films.

           This course investigates the representation of other worlds in texts and films. Whether depicted as matters of fact (as in cosmography), as a projection of ideal conditions in opposition to one’s own world (as in utopias), or as a mixed blessing when a person meets with circumstances that put everything he knows about the world at risk (as in travel accounts), other worlds offer the opportunity to investigate the encounter with difference as a fundamental aspect of human experience.

           Drawing from literature of the past 200 years, this course considers basic questions: What does it mean to be human—and who do we include in our definitions of "human?" What is the relationship of people to their landscape and environment? What is the relationship of technology to cultural production? How do gender and sexuality define or liberate us? And, ultimately, does the artist have an obligation to address any of these issues in his/her work? As a guide to our explorations, we look at the ways in which monsters and the monstrous illuminate particular cultural moments and reflect on whether the monsters of two centuries ago shed light on our own cultural preoccupations.

           Drawing from literature of the past 200 years, this course considers basic questions: What does it mean to be human—and who do we include in our definitions of "human?" What is the relationship of people to their landscape and environment? What is the relationship of technology to cultural production? How do gender and sexuality define or liberate us? And, ultimately, does the artist have an obligation to address any of these issues in his/her work? As a guide to our explorations, we look at the ways in which monsters and the monstrous illuminate particular cultural moments and reflect on whether the monsters of two centuries ago shed light on our own cultural preoccupations.

           There is no life without law. Nature has its laws. Religions have theirs, societies theirs, families theirs. Business has its rules and contracts. How do people understand the laws that are as much a part of life as the weather? Literature—the work of the imagination—guides our great journey towards understanding. Writers dramatize the relations among law, justice, and freedom. Writers also show the effect of law on the fates, fortunes, and feelings of people. The course explores the power of literature to show us what the law is, what it should not be, and what it might be.

           Originating in the idea of the world citizen and conceived in contradistinction to nationalism, cosmopolitanism can be understood as a perspective that regards human difference as an opportunity to be embraced rather than a problem to be solved. Does this perspective lie behind all "great" literature, which asks its readers to experience otherness by opening themselves up to another person's words and thoughts? This course uses novels, poems, plays, and films to explore the cosmopolitan impulses behind the literary imagination.

           Tragic drama originated in ancient Greece and it has been central to both the aesthetic and the philosophical traditions of the West. At the same time, many classic works of Western tragic drama have been adapted by cultures all over the world for their own ends. This course examines key works of Greek and Shakespearean tragedy, critical, historical, and philosophical reflections on these works, and versions of some of these works from non-Western cultures, especially in film.

           This class considers case studies in a global history of modernism in relation to two competing models of place: the ethnographic turn toward place that began in the late eighteenth century and continues in a wide array of projects today and, on the other hand, the idea of frictionless internationalism manifest in early twentieth-century modernism, and most of all in the slightly later concrete poetry movement.

           Using some classics of children’s literature from countries around the world, including several novels from the Harry Potter series, students examine the ways in which children’s literature offers insight into contemporary culture, particularly concerns about power and politics. Course readings include fairy tales and myths from around the world, as well as writings from theorists and philosophers who have used these “children’s stories” to analyze and explain aspects of the human experience. Focusing on questions of genre, influence, and intertextuality, students explore how—or if—“children’s literature” ultimately offers a more cosmopolitan perspective than literature intended solely for adults.

           This course uses texts and films to explore the speculative impulse behind narrative. Through the analysis of science fiction, utopian and dystopian narratives, texts from political theory, and even works considered to be “realist” in their orientation, students consider the ways in which works of fiction present their readers with thought experiments that pose different kinds of “what if” questions. Is it possible to conceive of speculative fiction as, in fact, the type of all fiction?

           The family has often been described as the nucleus of society. The course studies the representation of families—both biological and symbolic—as a source of blessings and burdens, bonding and betrayal in literary texts from around the world, starting with the Odyssey and moving on through the Middle Ages to modern writing. The course also investigates modern theories of the family as found in the works of such thinkers as Engels, Freud, and Foucault.

           This course examines a wide variety of literary texts on black-white couples, interracial families, and biracial identity, from classical antiquity to the present. Works studied include romances, novellas, plays, novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction, as well as some films and examples from the visual arts. Topics for discussion range from interracial genealogies to racial “passing,” from representations of racial difference to alternative plot resolutions, and from religious and political to legal and scientific contexts for the changing understanding of “race.”

           Among the more significant activities of human beings is that of giving shape to fears and desires through art.  All cultures participate in this form of emotional exteriorization, including creating “doubles” and “masks” through myths, literature, and other media.  Concentrating on doubles and masks in several different cultures, we will chart the meaning and impact of the archetypal masked figures of the
           <em>
            commedia dell’arte
           </em>
           in French and British theatre; the obsessive concern with the grotesque (the monstrous mask) in French romanticism and in Haitian magical realism; zombification, carnival figures, and ghostly doubles in Latin American, North American, and African cultural forms.  We build a repertory of approaches to interpreting and uncovering the many layers of masking and doubling by reading in anthropology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and literary theory.

           How do we respond to news that some among us are ill, and that the illness is, perhaps, contagious? Are the healthy ethically obliged to tend to the sick? What are the relationships between contagious disease and verbal communication: rumors, medical information, stories about the dying and the dead? How has illness literally and metaphorically participated in the reimagination of community, kinship, and sexuality in different times and places? This course examines the intersections of contagious disorder and storytelling in a range of cultures, settings, and forms, from ancient Greece to contemporary South Africa, from the Black Death, influenza, and AIDS to the proliferation of zombies and vampires in global popular culture today.

           How do you write a history of the world?  What is the relationship between history and storytelling?  How do we fashion meaning in history and interpret other civilizations? This course looks for answers to these questions in the first great histories of the known world, Herodotus’s
           <em>
            Histories
           </em>
           and Sima Qian’s
           <em>
            Records of the Historian
           </em>
           .  Addressing world history from the vantage point of ancient Greece and Ancient China, these works gave narrative an unprecedented geographical scope and acquired a textual authority previously enjoyed only by epics and chronicles.  They also yielded model accounts of cultural difference that have influenced other narrative forms in fiction and non-fiction, textual and visual culture - to this day.  In addition to Herodotus and Sima Qian, readings include selections from Homer and early Chinese chronicles, as well as contemporary historical fiction (such as Gore Vidal’s
           <em>
            Creation
           </em>
           ), the films
           <em>
            Hero
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            The Emperor and the Assassin
           </em>
           , and journalist Ryszard Kapuściński's memoir and travelogue
           <em>
            Travels with Herodotus
           </em>

           Oceans spell motion. They have transformed human destiny since the beginning of time. They are rolling spaces of experimentation and exchange,  hope and heartbreak, where peoples’ engagement with each other has unfolded, where humans have tussled with nature and interpreted the divine. Human interactions with oceans have spurred trade, set the boundaries of nations, built empires, redistributed populations, redefined tastes in food, produced new forms of art and music, transmitted diseases, and triggered new ideas and innovations in politics, law, science and technology. Above all, oceans continue to carry – and all too often thwart – the dreams of becoming and belonging of humans on the move. This course will explore the ways in which literary works across many genres – novels, plays, and poetry – have portrayed human relationships with oceans. It will prompt you to ask: how has the ocean functioned as a metaphor for the individual’s connection with nature and society? In what ways do depictions of oceans commemorate or comment upon a panoply of human experiences through time?  What affect and emotions do they encode? What identities do they create?

           This course offers a comparative approach to the work of Shakespeare, a world author whose influence can be felt throughout many cultures. In addition to exploring Shakespeare’s plays and poetry, the course also examines texts and films (e.g., Cesaire’s A Tempest, Robbins’s West Side Story, and Kurosawa’s Ran) that appropriate, rewrite, or write back to Shakespeare’s work and consider the processes that have made Shakespeare into an institution of culture worldwide.

           The advent of the novel marked a break with a magical way of thinking. "A magic curtain, woven of legends, hung before the world," writes Milan Kundera, "Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore the curtain." Is enchantment possible after modernity? And if so, what form might it take? A reenchantment as foreseen by religious cosmography, in which the human realm intersects with that of jinn or other supernatural beings? Or might the discoveries and technologies of the modern world--including the laws of physics and breakthroughs in science--themselves be conceived as enchanting? This course looks at attempts from various cultural vantage points to reconcile magic and realism in the aftermath of secularism and modernity. Must enchantment survive only as an escape from reason? Or might it be compatible with the Enlightenment and scientific inquiry? We will look at responses to the riddle of magic in modern society in the art, theatre, film and fiction of Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East. (Note: this course is unlikely to be available to students who have already completed LITCW-AD 120 Magic Realism)

           Reading the body in terms of physiognomy used to be a respected field of (natural) philosophy as well as common practice from ancient times onwards and around the globe. A (pseudo-)Aristotelian treatise and Pliny’s extensive writing on the subject in his
           <em>
            Natural History
           </em>
           , Chinese Tang-period perceptions and Japanese/Korean scholarship (as documented in
           <em>
            The Tale of Genji
           </em>
           ) give sufficient proof of the ubiquity of the subject’s dignity. The course will trace physiognomic patterns as a means to establish individual identity (e.g. Genji, Parzival) as well as otherness (e.g. Polo, Staden), starting with these texts and continuing through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It was only in the age of Enlightenment that severe criticism arose, branding physiognomy a pseudo-science and leaving only body language and facial expression as serious fields of empirical study. Modern cognitive science, however, has brought the subject back with a vengeance.

           We will read a wide-ranging selection of works from different cultures and chronological periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about what it means to be a human being faced with death.   We will examine the attitudes and actions of characters struggling to understand the meaning of death and who must decide whether they believe that death is an evil that harms them or is something they should just ignore. We will also consider the ways in which their views about immortality affect their actions and whether a desire for immortality has beneficial or detrimental affects on their lives and the lives of people around them.  More generally, we will be looking at some of the ways that different authors and cultures treat the question of how significant one’s death is to the continuing existence of others and what it means in different times and places to say that someone has died. Readings will include Euripides, Plato, Lucretius, Kyokai, Boccaccio, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Marquez, Morrison, Barnes, Salih, Hariharan, and Kanafani.

           The nation is as much cultural concept as political ideology. The formulation ‘nation and narration’ envisages both the construction of the nation
           <em>
            as
           </em>
           narration and the imaginings of the nation
           <em>
            in
           </em>
           narrative (historical and literary). To capture a sense of the wide-ranging connections between nation and narration we track, through a variety of texts across cultures, periods and genres, the spread of the idea of the modern nation from Europe to the rest of the world; the struggles of anti-colonial nationalisms; the birth of postcolonial nation-states; their subsequent trials and tribulations; the rhetoric of nationalism; the critiques of nationalism; the voices of minorities, immigrants and indigenous peoples that disrupt a homogeneous ‘national culture’; the phenomena of transnationalism and globalization; and their implications for the future of the nation-state. Readings and films to be studied include: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,

           Societies develop cultural behaviors that indicate the relative value of its members. Social acceptance has been historically dependent on its mutually constitutive term—ostracism—as members act on how they perceive and maintain their status in relationship to others. In this class, we will read novels, memoirs and plays that examine and deconstruct how systems of social worth operate, and how the nuances of those systems create and enforce devalued categories of people.  Readings focus on works that consider the specific attributes that adhere to the historically stigmatized categories of illness and disability.  We will discover how stigma affects feelings of self-worth and mediates engagement with others. Sociologist Erving Goffman observed that stigma creates “spoiled identities.”  Using ideas offered in Goffman’s seminal text on stigma, anthropologist Mary Douglas’s work on pollution and taboo, our readings will focus on authors who deconstruct experiences of stigma, and who write in order to destabilize, revise, and repair the personal and social damage stigmatizing categories and behaviors inflict.

           Humanity’s need to make sense of itself and its place in the universe has generated the world’s oldest creation stories and its most enduring myths. The quest for knowledge has itself also been a perennial theme of world literature. This course examines the impulse to construct knowledge in a variety of time periods and cultural traditions, raising questions about how human communities around the world have conceived of the nature, conditions, limits, and means of acquiring knowledge. Readings include ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian myths,

           Storytelling is a way for humans to understand the world and their position in it. This is particularly true for those who write to tell their own life stories. In this course, we will explore how these self-narratives allow their authors to comprehend their position in a globally connected world. We will read autobiographies by public figures and private citizens from different traditions and time periods who travel away from home and then write about their experience. Readings include Augustine’s Confessions (4th century), Al-Ghazali’s Deliverance from Error (11th century), Margery Kempe’s memoirs (15th century), Catalina de Erauso’s Memoirs of a Basque Lieutenant Nun (17th century), Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Confessions (18th century), Olaudah Equiano’s Interesting Narrative (18th century), N.O. Body’s Memoirs of a Man’s Maiden Years (1907), Buchi Emecheta’s Head Above Water (1986), Edward Said’s Out of Place (2000), and Sophia Al-Maria’s The Girl Who

           Diaspora has also been a recurring feature of human history since the dispersal of Jews from the Middle East, of Africans during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, or of the Irish during the Great Hunger. In the past two centuries, millions have migrated from their homelands to work or find refuge in far-away countries with cultures very different from their own. How do human beings come to terms with such conditions and transformations in their lives? What are the cultural, emotional, and intellectual effects of being exiled from your place of birth? How far can loss be compensated for by the idea that something can also be gained? In this course we consider connections and differences between experiences of exile, diaspora, and migration by examining stories and writing about them in the Bible, the
           <em>
            Odyssey
           </em>
           , and texts by Plutarch, Ovid, Dante, Byron, Dostoevsky, Conrad, Césaire, Naipaul, Rhys, Lamming, Carpentier, Darwish, Edward Said, Julia Alvarez and Kiran Desai.

           From mythological figures such as Coyote in North America, Hermes of Greek Myth and Eshu in West Africa, to modern icons of global pop culture like Charlie Chaplin, Bugs Bunny, and Bart Simpson, humans have long been fascinated with trickster characters who transgress boundaries, break rules, and unsettle fixed truths. Seemingly heedless of cultural norms, these characters in their many different guises point to the important role of play and disruption in the making of culture. In this course, students will consider rogues, outlaws, and outsiders of various types from around the world and their portrayal in stories, novels, dramas, songs, and films. Building a repertoire of trickster characters, types, and tropes, students examine how these characters’ dynamic roles relate to central problems of art, creativity, and life.

           Autobiographies and memoirs (both a subgroup of socalled ego documents) are commonly taken to be “authentic” and “objective” representations of what the author lived through – but they are not. Both genres are literary texts to which the distinction between an author and a narrator (the “I”) applies. Both
           <br/>
           genres concern themselves with a reflection of the self in contexts that vary across history and civilisations. They may be concerned with the development of the persona in terms of identity, religion, intellectual achievements, political conditions, etc. Autobiography differs from memoir in scope, the first being more comprehensive and pertaining to the development of the “I”, the latter concentrating on a crucial event in history as perceived by the “I”. The course traces the genres from the very first documents in history to the present day, spanning a large variety of civilisations: from Greek and Roman antiquity, the Middle Ages in Arab, European, and Indian cultures, the Italian Renaissance and the Enlightenment on to examples from American, Indian, European, Japanese, Chinese, and Iranian authors.

           This course examines a variety of cultural conceptions of money and wealth, and the ethical questions that money or wealth allows a writer to probe. Is the value of men measured by the value of their money, or are there other criteria for wealth? Is someone’s wealth possible without someone else’s poverty? How is human ambition rewarded or punished in the “pecuniary culture”? The course looks for answers to these and other questions in key works of literature, sociology, economics and other fields, reading classical texts ranging from Aristophanes' Plutus, Ihara Saikaku's "A dose of what the doctor never orders," and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, to Honoré de Balzac's Père Goriot, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. Readings will be supplemented by excerpts from works by Ibn Khaldun, Adam Smith, Thorstein Veblen, Max Weber, and Alfred Hirshman.

           As the Arabic saying goes, “Health is a crown worn by the healthy and seen only by the ill.” Throughout history, literature has staged the human struggle with disease and the related search for a cure. This course depicts the literary representation of pathologies and their medical treatments, ranging from eighteenth-century European treatises on the “English Malady” to the depiction of tuberculosis and leprosy in twentieth-century Japan. In the attempt to restore health, the relationship between patient and doctor is of central importance and therefore constitutes a thematic focus for this course. Readings will include: George Cheyne’s The English Malady, Franz Kafka’s “Country Doctor,” Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” Yahya Hakki’s Lamp of Umm Hashim, Bernard Pomerance’s The Elephant Man, Albert Camus’ The Plague, Sigmund Freud’s Dora, Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “Yellow Wallpaper,” Ernest Hemingway’s “Indian Camp,” Gail Tsukiyama’s The Samurai’s Garden, and Sanjay Gupta’s Monday Mornings.

           For the first time in human history, the weather is
           <em>
            about us
           </em>
           .  Growing scientific evidence of catastrophic—and anthropogenic— climate change brings new urgency to an old question: how do we humans conceive of our relationship to “nature”? This course explores how imaginative writers have situated the human in relation to Earth’s many landscapes, plants, climates, and species. How have they depicted meaningful encounters between humans and the other animals? What have they suggested about humans’ responsibilities to the countless other living beings with whom we share this planet? How have they “mapped” the slippery and shifting conceptual ground that lies between the “man-made” and the “natural”? And how might a renewed engagement with this vast theme help us deal with the heavy weather ahead? Readings include

           The theme of this class will be the discovery and exploration of the concept of the soul in the religious and philosophic traditions of the Mediterranean.  We will focus on the great questions about the soul--the conscious self and its identity-- persisting up to and perhaps beyond death:  What
           <em>
            is
           </em>
           it to be a person in a body?  Is there something that is our essential self, independent of the body? Is this something conscious? Does it include the mind? Does it survive death? How exactly?  Will it be judged, as Plato and Socrates thought and many religions suggest? We will explore these ideas from the Greeks through the Christians and Muslims, reading Homer, Plato, Augustine and Ibn Sina.  The class will conclude with a glimpse at the late Renaissance, when the permanence and even presence of human souls became more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in the ancient and medieval worlds.  In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way, whether to faith--or away from it.

           Mankind’s relationship to animals has always been ambivalent. Animals have been deified and demonised, petted and abused, cherished and exploited. While modern science is increasingly blurring the supposed demarcation line between animals (equalling nature) and humans (equalling reason), literature has allowed for transgressions that have worked both ways: transformations go from human to animal and vice versa. Not only this; throughout history animals have been thought to possess human qualities (and also: vice versa) such as speech and reason and have been represented to act in a way that often seems more human than the way humans behave. The class starts with the earliest literary document of mankind, The Epic of Gilgamesh, looks at texts from Antiquity and the Middle Ages from various civilisations (Aesopus, The Jataka Tales, The Panchatantra, Apuleius, Lucian, The Physiologus, The Journey to the West) and up to modern times (Darwin, Carroll, Kipling, Kafka, Dick) and also one film which especially reflects upon the strained relationship to an animal and man’s self-perception in the face of nature (Moby Dick).

           We will explore the relation of knowledge and doubt in a wide variety of texts in different genres, historical periods, and cultural contexts. Some our questions will be about sources of knowledge and evidence, while others will be about the nature of our capacities for knowing things. Questions include:  what sources of knowledge can we trust, if any? Are there ways to achieve knowledge by transcending our normal sensory and rational capacities?  Might we be systematically deceived about the world and, if so, could we still find happiness in such a condition? Is our knowledge inevitably dependent on others or are our best sources of knowledge found within?  How can our knowledge be distorted by strong emotions such as hatred or love? Readings will be from Mo-Tzu, Sophocles, Nagarjuna, Ibn Tufayl, Dante, Montaigne, Cervantes, Descartes, Hume, Rousseau, and Proust.

           Laughter is an essential part of the human experience. Why do we laugh, and what does it mean? How does laughter function within us as individuals, in our local circles, and as a global community? What evokes laughter that transcends culture, and what is culturally specific? In this course students will confront laughter and its capacity to disarm, connect, heal, teach, debunk, humiliate, reform, confront, expose, progress, politicize, humanize, and empower. The course readings will include literature, visual art, theater, film, television, animation, new media, psychology, and biology. Students will encounter such artists, writers and thinkers as Nasreddin Hoca, Aristophanes, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Margaret Cho, Jim Henson, Frida Kahlo, Oscar Wilde, Jane Austen, Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Joss Whedon, Tina Fey, and Takashi Murakami.

           The fundamental question we will probe in this course is how narratives represent our coming to know.  Ever since the Enlightenment, the West typically assumes knowing to be the achievement of a rational subject moving progressively through lawful space and time—and figuring things out.  Only a lawful world allows the questing subject to arrive at knowledge and self-knowledge.  This progressive story serves as a central target of modernist and postcolonial critique.  Writers such as Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kafka, Freud, Faulkner, and Beckett call into question the narrative of the knowing Western subject.  Garcia-Marquez’s postcolonial One Hundred Years of Solitude simply dispenses with Western priorities of knowing and self-knowledge.

           Scientists believe that our planet is experiencing its sixth mass extinction (the fifth, caused by a meteor collision, occurred 65 million years ago).  Many even have called for the recognition of a new epoch, the Anthropocene, to mark the massive impact of human activities and human-induced extinctions on its biosphere.  But how do we make sense of this era’s accelerating rate of species death?  What is the relationship between the extinction of a species and the extinction of cultures, languages, and lifeways?  How have biodiversity loss, language death, the vanishing of “savage races” and aboriginal populations, genocide, and the specter of self-extinction shaped our understanding of what it means to be human?  This course examines the human encounter with biotic, cultural, and metaphorical extinctions in a variety of genres, from Darwin’s reflections aboard the
           <em>
            Beagle
           </em>
           to the preservation of Ishi (“the last wild Indian),” and from flood narratives to apocalyptic fantasies.

           Dreaming is a trait that human beings share with a lot of other mammals. It was, however,  not until Freud’s insights into the subjective nature of dreams and especially neuroscience’s explorations of the material basis of dreams and their cognitive function, that dreams were considered to belong in the realm of metaphysics. Thus, they served supernatural powers as a vehicle for prophecy and premonition. Literature has made use of these specific qualities in order to reflect on the dreaming persons’ ethical motivations, impulses to act, finding their identity, being deluded or informed and changing their ways. The class spans texts and one film (Kubrick) that represent dreams, either literally or metaphorically, from Antiquity (Cicero) to the present day (Borges) and across a variety of civilisations.

           All cultures define what it is to be human. This course traces some disagreements among cultures over these definitions of the human. More specifically, all cultures are fascinated by individuals who do not fit definitions of the human—individuals who fall short or soar above their peers by commingling human with nonhuman ways and forms of being. Werewolves, wild men, serpent women, and bird people test human nature against other natures. Sometimes these creatures find human nature lacking, and supplement the lack by reaching out into other natures; other times their transformations stage confrontations between civilization and chaos. We will survey how narrative artists have imagined the commingling of humanity and nonhumanity across several centuries and cultures. What are the attractions of getting beyond, or sinking below, the limits of the human? Why do cultures set those limits? What resources does literature offer for thinking about self-definition in relation to social responsibility? The films and reading include:

           There are more migrants worldwide today than Brazil has inhabitants. China, India, and the Philippines are sending most migrants; the most important host areas are Europe and the United States; and expats make up more than 60% of the total population in Qatar and the UAE. How has migration been represented in and shaped by literature and art? This course reviews exemplary texts, striking images, and important films. Focus is on the United States from around 1880 to World War II and on Europe in the second half of the twentieth century, then opening up toward students’ examination of cultural work by and about contemporary migrants from around the world. Readings include autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and creative visual work. Among the topics for discussion are metaphors and theories of migration (from uprooting and bird-of-passage to expatriate and melting-pot); labor arrangements; scenes of departure, voyage, and arrival; vibrant migrant communities and migrant alienation and pain; negotiation between places of origin and of arrival.

           This course draws upon literature, folk tales, films, and paintings to connect and compare the ways in which slavery has been imagined, experienced, narrated, and contested in different parts of the world from antiquity to the present. We will start by charting cross-cultural debates over “slave” and “citizen” through the ages, before proceeding to explore texts and images that positioned the “slave” as subject, and used literacy as a mode of resistance. How did these narratives define “freedom” and shape international abolitionist publics? How might we read them for evidence of slave culture and community, and imaginaries of race, gender, and nation?  How do novels and films serve as sites of public memory --or amnesia -- about slavery? What do they tell us about the threshold between history and literature? How does historical context serve to explain fiction? How do novelists and artists both use and challenge the archives to imagine “agency” in ways that official history writing does not accommodate? Course materials may be drawn from the works of Aristotle, Manu, Kautilya, Bartolomé de las Casas, George Fitzhugh, Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Toni Morrison, Caryl Phillips, Amitav Ghosh, Rayda Jacob, and Abdurazak Gurnah, as well as the Uncle Remus Tales, and paintings and excerpts from the films Gone with the Wind, Amistad, Beloved, Twelve Years a Slave, Ceddo, Razia Sultan, Rue Cases Nègres, and Quilombo.

           Most of us agree that we should be tolerant. Often the call for tolerance is grounded in relativism—the thought that there isn’t a fact of the matter. After all, on what basis could we insist that others share our beliefs if those beliefs are subjective, a function of upbringing or our peculiar tastes and concerns? But should we accept relativism? Can relativism justify tolerance? If not, then how can we justify tolerance?

           This course examines the determinants of economic development in the modern world. The course is divided into two parts. The first reviews theories that place factors of production such as labor and technology as the main cause of cross-country differences in economic wealth. The second part of the course investigates the role of institutions, culture, religion, geography, and luck as deeper causes of comparative development. The main questions addressed throughout the course are: Why are there such large differences in income per capita across countries? Why have some countries developed steadily over the past 200 years while many others have not? Why do some governments adopt policies that promote economic development while others set up barriers to economic activity? These questions are analyzed from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

           The course focuses on the concept of truth, addressing such central questions as whether there is such a thing as “absolute” truth; what truth is; why it is worth searching for; and how we can find it. Answers from a variety of intellectual and cultural traditions are considered. They are assessed for their adequacy in dealing with a range of domains in which truth is at issue—including science, morality, politics, religion, and aesthetics.

           This course covers historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.

           This course examines the relationship between government and religion. To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: "Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.

           This course examines the relationship between government and religion. To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: "Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.

           How have diseases, and efforts to control them, shaped the nature and course of human societies? Are diseases actors in their own right? What determines who falls sick and who dies? This course explores the complex relationship between disease and society, between the natural and social worlds. Our focus is on understanding how people have explained, argued about, and responded to diseases in different social contexts over time. The course readings consist of books drawn from a range of disciplines.

           This course considers the intellectual, ethical, and political stakes of incorporating animal-centered perspectives into frameworks of social scientific inquiry. We examine how animals are socially or culturally constructed in “traditional” and “modern” societies, and consider proposals for studying animals as minded social actors. Readings include religious, scientific, philosophical, and political texts from Arabic/Islamic, Chinese, and Judeo-Christian literatures.

           In this seminar, we explore one of the great intellectual encounters that has shaped the history of Western thought. On the one side are the pagan Greeks, with their ideas of wisdom and excellence, and their belief in the eternal order of the world. On the other are the children of Abraham - those who affirm the existence of a transcendent creator God; who deny the eternality of the world; and who insist on the supremacy of will over reason. Since Tertullian in the second century CE, the clash between these two systems of ideas has been known as the conflict between Athens and Jerusalem.

           The human sciences, born of the Enlightenment’s quest to recreate Man in its image, gave rise to a paradox. In brokering reconfigurations of the essence and boundaries of the human, new models for socio-political organization, and claims to inalienable human rights, they also demarcated and fortified the supposedly ‘natural’ fault lines between sexes, races, cultures, and peoples. The course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the nature of cultural distinction and the historical development of the Image of Man in a variety of global case studies, from the eighteenth century to the present.

           We live simultaneously in an age of science and an era of great religious faith, when reason and revelation are often depicted as being in inherent and eternal tension. In this course we trace the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day, drawing on primary sources and secondary readings from religious studies, the history of science, and anthropology.

           The course grapples with love, a blind spot in social theory, and its relation with religion, transcendence, sacrifice, and faith. On the one hand, sexuality and gender have become objects of intense concern, politicized by religious movements around the world from the fundamentalist Christians in America to Islamists and pietists in the Islamic world. On the other hand, for large numbers of young people in the Western world not only has sexuality become increasingly unhinged from love, but love has become a troubling category, something uncertain and dangerous to believe in. This course examines the relation between love, sex, and religion as they reverberate in both the private and public spheres.

           This class examines a few universal, global patterns in the history of families and the many ways that families are culturally diverse. We begin with a historical survey, from the "traditional" families that once dominated throughout the world, to the "modern" (industrial) and "post-modern" (post-industrial) family values that appear today. Then we focus on particular aspects of family life: childhood; dating and courtship; sex and reproduction; husband-wife relations; old age; female-headed and other non-traditional families.

           There are many different ways in which human beings represent themselves. I represent myself as a living being, as belonging to a given society and culture, as having a given character, and so on. But do I have a representation of myself as the author of those representations? Exploring this question casts light on central questions of philosophy, for instance the relation between mind and body, the relation between self and other, or the belief that we have freedom of the will. Readings may include selections from Western philosophy and Buddhist philosophy as well as neuroscience, psychology, psychoanalysis, and literary works.

           Cities are probably the most efficient social networks. They allow for increased communication and innovation. They are natural spaces for deliberation and collective action. This course explores the reasons why cities rise and decline, the mechanisms of formal and informal urban planning, skyscrapers and suburbs, urban nature and urban design. In-class sessions will alternate with workshops on Abu Dhabi, visits to the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council, and mini-fieldwork in the city.

           Being part of a family and of being related, or kin, to other human beings is a universal human experience; it is fundamental to our sense of ourselves. Yet what we mean by family or by kinship changes dramatically across societies and through time. This course introduces social scientific approaches to and methods for understanding and analyzing this diversity; it therefore asks students to explore the relationship between the universal and what is specific to particular societies and cultures.

           This is a course about how and why finance matters. From credit derivatives to pyramid schemes, home mortgages to credit cards, finance both underwrites the aspirations and lines the underbelly of the contemporary economy. Finance also shapes the urban environment, producing new city forms and social structures. Drawing on sociology, anthropology, fiction, and film, our seminar examines finance as a mode of social relations and cultural meaning in contemporary capitalism.

           What does gender as category of analysis indicate? How does gender intersect with other axes of identity such as class, nation, and ethnicity in a globalized world? The course introduces students to select women’s issues (e.g. employment, political participation, reproductive rights and healthcare, feminism vs. multiculturalism, gender based violence, and peace building) that have emerged in the global context and the international debates that surround them. In addition, the course looks at the relevance of women’s representation to address barriers to gender equality in the ‘democratic process’ as well as the shortcomings of democratic mechanisms to achieve women’s rights and some proposed solutions to these limitations.

           “Culture,” wrote Raymond Williams, “is one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language.” Modernity, arguably, is another. Moreover, “culture” and “modernity” are often held to be at odds with one another; if modernity can be defined by its claim to universal applicability, then culture(s) mark the disjunctures and discrepancies that repeatedly disrupt this narrative. This course examines the (cross-) cultural politics and imaginaries of “modernity” to ask: What does it mean to be modern in the global present?

           Financial systems direct flows of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. This course compares the theories implicit in the U.S. and UAE financial systems and describes how they work in practice. Whereas credit and interest are central to U.S. banking, Shari’ah law forbids interest, so Islamic banking uses profit- and loss-sharing to organize investment. By comparing these two systems, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in a global context.

           This course explores the ways in which urban landscapes have traditionally served as fragile repositories for collective memory from the first monuments of Near Eastern civilizations to the modern architecture of contemporary global cities. Some cities seek to preserve their pasts, while others aggressively brush aside older forms and structures to make way for the new. Students examine the “politics” of urban memory, exploring historical and contemporary debates about the conflicting demands of preservation and modernization in a variety of cities from around the world.

           Gift giving occurs in all cultures. A gift can be a material object or money, but it can also be an act of kindness or love. A gift is free but it can also come with the expectation that it will be matched by a return gift. Gift giving is therefore part of a complex structure of economic and social exchange. This course considers gift giving from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and the arts; it explores gift exchange through ethnographies as well as texts on market economies and art, gender, death, altruism, risk, and the impacts of colonialism on traditional exchange societies. Readings will include seminal works on gift exchange by Marcel Mauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, Franz Boas, and others.

           What are the foundations of political legitimacy and to what extent do governments abide by them? In this course, we will explore these questions using both classical and contemporary accounts. The first half of the course focuses on political systems in Ancient Greece, Rome, Medieval Europe, and Early Modern Europe through the lens of great thinkers, including Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Burke, Weber, and Marx, as well as a series of primary source documents. We then proceed to the “post-1789” world and discuss legitimacy in the context of democratic government. Topics covered include the role of legislators, issue representation, descriptive vs. substantive governance, and the ongoing debate between advocates of majoritarianism and those of proportionalism.

           This course traces the development of philosophical, religious and secular theories of peace from antiquity to the present. It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a “just war,” as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J. Muste, Johan Galtung, Alma Myrdal, and Petra Kelly, among others.

           The institution of property describes one of the fundamental relationships between people: the relationship between people as it pertains to things. In this seminar, we explore how understandings of property have been influenced by cultural and ethical norms in different civilizations; how property rights have evolved with technological progress and changes in the demands of the environment; how property is affected by and influences the sphere of individual freedom, the relation between the individual and the state, and the organization of productive activity.  As examples, we will look at property in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome; consider the views on property expressed in Christianity and Islam as well as the role that changing views on property played in the Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution. We will use our insights to debate contemporary issues in property rights of interest to seminar participants. These might include intellectual property rights, rights to genetic material, inheritance, airwaves, financial regulation, the rights of indigenous tribes of the Amazon rainforest, claims on the Arctic, or the trade-off between rights to privacy and freedom of the press.

           Topics covered may include: The concept of a neural basis of consciousness and how we could discover what it is; whether there are different kinds of consciousness;  the relation between consciousness and attention, cognitive accessibility, intentionality and agency; the function of consciousness; the unity of consciousness; whether the representational contents of perception are just colors, shapes and textures or include “rich” properties such as facial expressions and causation.  The course will also cover some theories of consciousness such as mind/body dualism, behaviorism, functionalism, physicalism and theories of consciousness as representation.  Readings from philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and David Chalmers and neuroscientists such as Hakwan Lau and Stanislas Dehaene.

           Political governments claim to exercise authority and not merely power.  What is the distinction between authority and power, and the basis of governmental claims to legitimately exercise authority?  The course examines theories of legitimate authority.  Some claim that political authority derives from God.  Others hold that political authority derives from the consent of the governed. Still others argue that political authority is never legitimate.  We shall explore the classical views of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and the anarchist tradition embodied by Robert Paul Wolfe, and read in both western and non-western traditions, secular and the non-secular traditions.

           Polarization has been a feature of societies around the world since the inception of human civilization. To this day, individuals routinely sort themselves in to groups based on share political, social, religious, or cultural beliefs. In turn, these sorted groups often find themselves at polar extremes from one another, something that has often led to intense, and sometimes violent, conflict. In this course, we will explore the history, emergence, and pervasiveness of various kinds of polarization: ethnic, linguistic, religious, political, and geographic. We will begin the course by defining polarization and looking at examples of it from antiquity to the present. Thereafter, we will look at the consequences of polarization for politics, social interactions, and economics. The course will be taught using classical works by kings and statesmen (e.g., Constantine of Rome, Louis XIV of France, Woodrow Wilson), as well as contemporary scholarship from a diverse group of scholars: historians, demographers, political scientists, biologists, and economists. Special attention will be given to social media and social networking, a pervasive aspect of contemporary social polarization; it will serve as the basis for a course-long project.

           Life is rife with

            hard choices.
           </em>
           Should you become a doctor or a lawyer? How much should you sacrifice in order to help others? Should you marry and have children? This course examines the phenomenon of hard choices by focusing on two questions: (1) what makes a choice hard? and (2) what should/does one do when faced with a hard choice? We explore answers to these questions from a variety of perspectives – philosophical, religious, literary, psychological, and neuroscientific.

           The question of God(s) pertains to the existence, manifestations, meaning, and attributes of the sacred.  Although conceptions about the sacred are inevitably shaped by history and culture, the fundamental question of God(s) has had an enduring presence throughout human experience.  This course takes up this perennial human question from the context of some of the world’s major religious traditions including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism.  What similarities do these great traditions share, and how does their understanding of the sacred differ?  Additionally, the course explores the relation between reason and faith.  How does the empirical verification characteristic of an increasingly pervasive scientific and technological worldview impact on belief in God(s)?  Readings for the course are drawn from a variety of disciplines with a focus on primary sources and seminal works.

           This course examines slavery in historical and comparative perspective by focusing on Greek and Roman slavery, African and Islamic slavery, and slavery in the American South, Brazil, and the Caribbean.  We will examine the nature and centrality of the institution of slavery, the difference between societies in which slavery existed and those which can be thought of as “slave societies, “ asking such questions as how did enslavement occur and who were the people enslaved and in what ways were did they differ from non-slaves? What “rights” or standing in the law if any did slaves possess? What was the nature and extent of the master’s power over their slaves? What were the social, economic and political functions of slavery? These are important questions for understanding slavery.  But the study of slavery inevitably involves broader, more fundamental issues concerning freedom, personhood, social inclusion and belonging.  As Orlando Patterson put it in the most far-reaching study of slavery, Slavery and Social Death,  “the idea of freedom and the concept of property were both intimately bound up with the rise of slavery, their very antithesis.  Once we understand the dynamics of slavery, we immediately realize why there is nothing in the least anomalous about the fact that an Aristotle or a Jefferson owned slaves."

           This course poses the fundamental questions:  “What is law?”; “What is a legal system?; and “What is the rule of law?”  Appreciating that law reflects different cultural and historical facts, the course employs a comparative methodology in order to explore the fundamental questions from the perspective of various legal traditions.   This comparative methodology considers jurisprudence from African, Chinese, Hindu, Marxist, Islamic, Southeast Asian, and Western legal traditions.   In relation to these diverse legal traditions, the course examines the topics of natural law, legal positivism, interpretivism, legal realism, justice, human rights, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, critical race theory, and post-modernist jurisprudence.

           Revolutions, i.e. the rapid, massive and often violent change in the political and economic arrangements of society, mark the modern epoch starting with England in the 1640s, America in 1776, and France in 1789.  Revolutions obviously continue today. But what are revolution’s causes, typical course and consequences? Why such passion and energy? A systematic comparison of different revolutions informed by both the classical and contemporary theories of revolution might offer a few startling insights.

           Political corruption exists everywhere, but which countries are most corrupt? Do highly corrupt countries have common characteristics? How much corruption is there? The social costs of political corruption, from stealing public funds to paying bribes to avoid basic safety and healthy regulations, are often extremely high. Why are most attempts to fight corruption unsuccessful? The course is comparative and historical, and as far as possible requires no background knowledge.

           There is the economics of economists, highfalutin and opaque theoretical models, and then there is economic activity as we experience it in our everyday lives and settings. Between the two stands a wall of incomprehension. From work to love, from social networks to family life, consumption, money, witchcraft, slavery, digital economies, slums, and ghettos, these spheres of everyday life ask us hard questions about the nature of the economic realities we inhabit. This course will seek to explore the everyday life of economic experience in a way that can capture its richness, diversity, and complexity. To that end, we will be drawing on a range of sources, from classical philosophy, to journalism, sociology, anthropology, manga, film, history, literature and even economics in search of a few answers.

           What is an ideology? How do a series of sometimes disparate beliefs about issues come together to form an ideology? How do ideologies change and reform over time? In this course, we explore these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. We begin by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, we read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Robespierre, Burke, Jefferson, Marx, Lenin, Mosca, and (Benedict) Anderson.  Thereafter, we look at how to
           <em>
           </em>
           measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter). In the last part of the course, we examine how shifting ideologies beliefs have (or might have) consequences for a wide range of human phenomena, ranging from interpersonal interactions to elections and international conflict.

           What are the social, political, and economic forces that bring consumer goods into being, keep them there, and then cause them to disappear from household use and enter the world’s waste stream? Searching for what anthropologist Mary Douglas called “an anthropology of consumption,” we will look across history and places, to pre-modern Japan, Renaissance England, the contemporary UAE and North America.  We ask about the politics of things and their shifting roles in everyday life. What is the nature of taste? of shopping? How do shifts occur depending on object, place, and time? We will explore the logistics of fashion, the link between goods and geography, production systems, and distribution through retail markets.  We stretch theoretically across the political economy of Marx, neo-classical economics, and the more recent cultural-social schemas of Bruno Latour and Howard Becker. For a final project students will focus on a specific object that they research and present to class, based on readings, discussions and original research.

           The course is about the nature of language, of thought, and of the relation between them.  Among the questions to be asked are: Are there such things as
           <em>
            meanings
           </em>
           , and if so, what sorts of things are they?  How do the meanings of linguistic expressions depend on the speech acts the expressions are used to perform?  Is linguistic representation to be explained in terms of mental representation?  Vice versa?  Or is neither to be explained in terms of the other?  How from a finite stock of words is it possible for a language to construct an infinite number of sentences, each with its own meaning?  How is it possible for a child to acquire—in just a few years and without any instruction—the ability to understand indefinitely many sentences never previously encountered by herself or anyone else?  In grappling with these and other questions we will study work in philosophy, theoretical linguistics and cognitive psychology.

           This course focuses on the purposes and consequences of growth and development, addressing the fundamental questions of why we need economic growth and its impacts on world resources, the environment and social well-being.  Concerns about growth and progress are nothing new, but have intensified due to our concern with climate change, sustainability, inequality, and existential risks for humanity. The course explores classical and contemporary schools of thought regarding rationales for growth, as well as social and moral consequences of development. Students will consider philosophical and political arguments for and against growth; analyze complex relationships between individual and society, between humankind and nature, and ultimately, between economic growth and cosmic evolution; recognize unintended consequences of growth, and gain an appreciation for our responsibilities at a time when technological progress poses unlimited potential as well as daunting challenges.

           Human beings differ from machines, and perhaps also from other animals, in the way we encounter the world—always from a first-personal perspective, an awareness of oneself
           <em>
            in
           </em>
           the world and not merely
           <em>
            of
           </em>
           the world. But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, by finding some particular function of the brain? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called “the human condition”? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any single other topic, have had something important to say. We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek and Jaina intellectual cultures, and look critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovskiy; and at dissenters from Vasubandhu to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion—or, worse, a deceit.

           In 1500 the economic, social, and political differences between Europe and Asia were small.  By the twentieth century, the gaps were enormous.  How can we explain this Great Divergence between Europe and Asia?  The course will discuss the classical answers to this question given by Weber, Smith, Marx, and Malthus.  Has modern research confirmed or contradicted their views?  The roles of demography, politics, law, globalization, social structure, science, and technology will be discussed as well as the interconnections between them.  The course aims to expose the methods that social scientists and historians use to answer grand questions of social evolution, so that the approaches can be compared, contrasted, and assessed.

           Emotions have been understood since Antiquity to stand at the heart of human motivation and agency, as well as to influence diverse facets of the human condition, from family formation, empathy, and socialization, to choice-making, aggression, and war. Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical, and social-engineering projects, and the collusion of emotional and political regimes, it further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants, beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. Course readings include works by Homer, Aristotle, Dharmakīrti, Ibn Sina, Abelard and Heloise, Shigesuke, Descartes, Spinoza, Campe, Darwin, and Freud, as well as relevant secondary scholarship.

           We will read and discuss works of major writers to explore the role that the moral emotions, shame and guilt, have played and still play, in our individual and collective lives.  We will ask whether these two emotive forces are parallel or antagonistic in their effects on our behavior.  We will apply the concepts of shame and guilt to the understanding of psychology and moral value systems, and of different patterns of culture and politics.  We will attempt to understand how shame and guilt can both serve adaptive (life-supporting) as well as maladaptive (life-destroying) functions.  Finally, we will ask whether developing the capacity to love can enable us to transcend the destructive outcomes that both shame and guilt, and the ethical systems they motivate, can generate.  Authors studied will include Homer, Sophocles, the Bible, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Freud, Ruth Benedict, Pierre Bourdieu, Salman Rushdie and Kanan Makiya.

           The course will examine issues that arise concerning the concept(s) of life.  It will particularly consider various attempts to say what the ‘aim’ or ‘meaning’ of life might be.  Readings will be from a range of sources, philosophical, scientific, and literary.  We begin with biological life (how to distinguish living from non-living entities; the “units” and “levels” of life).  We then turn to a more “biographical” notion of life, applying especially to human lives.  (Is there a natural or typical structure to “a life”?  Is the unity of a life a matter of degree, and what does it depend on?  Is narration the best way to describe or understand a life? )  Finally we turn to the value of life and lives.  (Does all life have value, and by virtue of what?  Does each human life have absolute value, or is it legitimate to compare and rank the values of different lives?)  Readings will include works or extracts by Aristotle, Euripides, Whitman, Darwin, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Sartre, as well as religious texts such as The Bhagavad-Gita, the Diamond Sutra, and the Tao Te Ching.

           Course description: Most English-speaking people can answer the question, “What is your religion?” … even if the answer is “I am an atheist, so I don’t have one.” Yet the things we call religions are remarkably diverse. They differ, for example, in whether they address one God, no gods or many; how important they think explicit creeds are; how much attention they give to prayer, fasting and other rituals; and whether adherents are expected to dress or eat or engage in other everyday practices in a distinctive way. In this course we’ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science—E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim. Among our questions will be, “Is
           <em>
            religion
           </em>
           a European concept?”

           This multidisciplinary course examines the historical, sociological, cultural, and political significance of surveillance, with a particular focus on the relationship between surveillance and privacy. Drawing on a wide range of sources (­including academic research, historical documents, literature, film, and social media), the course explores how developments in the practice and technologies of surveillance have shaped the ways in which we think about privacy, identity, and personal information over the last 3000 years. Among the central questions that animate the course are: What is the relationship between surveillance and governance?  How has the emergence of various forms of electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about identity and individual privacy? How do we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security in a world characterized by increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of state and private surveillance? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, paying particular attention to the ways in which certain major events (such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States) have shaped how we think about surveillance and its relationship to privacy, security, and democracy.

           Computer Science is an innovative and exciting field that focuses on producing efficient solutions (Algorithms) and solving problems in any field. This course introduces students to the foundations of computer science. Students learn how to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs using a high-level programming language. The course covers core programming concepts including: basic computation; data structure; control structure; iterative structures; file I/O and exception handling; recursion, sorting, searching, and functions. Students also learn the elements of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), such as objects, classes, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and interface. OOP is a programming paradigm used to solve complex systems. Students produce programs focusing on scientific concepts, graphics, games, and web CGI implementation. Students design, test, and develop innovative software applications such as games, interactive websites, and other projects related to different fields. In a final project, they develop a fully functioning, interactive, fun game that employs a clean design, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), simple to moderate strategy, and event-handling techniques.

           Algorithms lie at the heart of computer science. An algorithm is an effective procedure, expressed as a finite list of precisely defined instructions, for solving problems that arise in applications in any domain of knowledge. All computer programs are translations of algorithms into some programming language. Often the most difficult parts of designing an algorithm are to make sure that when it is programmed in a computer, it runs as fast as possible and does what it was designed to do. This course gives an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms for solving problems that arise in a variety of applications such as robotics, artificial intelligence, music, bioinformatics, sorting and searching data, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.

           A digital computer consists of hardware and software that users employ to solve problems in a wide variety of applications. The operating system in a computer is a collection of software that functions as the chief manager that oversees the interactions between the user, the applications, the software and the hardware, and is responsible for scheduling the many tasks involved, in an efficient and user-friendly manner. This course covers high-level design of key operating system concepts such as process scheduling and synchronization; concurrency, deadlocks and their prevention; memory management, including (demand) paging and segmentation; and I/O and file systems. Students learn about the design and implementation of the operating systems that run on your personal computers and smartphones. This is a hands-on course where students implement (in C, C++, Java, or C#) operating system components like those found in Windows, UNIX/Linux, and Android.

           We all access powerful computer systems/ servers in our daily lives searching for information, purchasing online products, making online banking transactions, and even registering and paying for classes online. Unix/Linux system administrators have to constantly install, maintain, and manage these complex systems. They also need to secure and protect the data stored on these systems. One of the most powerful and secure operating systems used to manage these systems is the Unix/ Linux operating system. Students learn to use basic Unix/Linux tools such as shells, windowing systems, regular expressions, Vim and Emacs, awk, grep, and tar for file management, process control, rudimentary shell scripts, and environment customization. Students learn how to make systems secure using PGP and Truecrypt. Perl and Python is used for shell scripting. Students learn to use collaborative tools such as version control systems and wikis, typesetting systems such as LaTex, computational tools such as Matlab, and web development tools, such as HTML, Javascript, and CGI. The content of this course is regularly revised to track the developing technologies, so the information listed here is only representative.

           Human beings communicate with computers by means of computer programs written in some computer language. It can be difficult to instruct by means of languages what we want a computer to do, and it can be easy to write programs that are incomprehensible or even incorrect, leading to disastrous consequences. An ideal computer language makes the difficult problem easy and the easy problem difficult. In this course the student are exposed to the four major categories of programming languages: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Specific languages are chosen for illustration. Topics to be covered include fundamental issues, lambda-calculus, type systems, scoping, concurrency, modularization, control flow, and semantics.

           There are many cognitive tasks such as recognizing letters and people’s faces, that people do easily and almost unconsciously, but that have proven extremely difficult to program on a computer. Artificial intelligence is concerned with developing algorithms, computer programs, and computer systems that can carry out these tasks. Topics to be covered include heuristic search; problem solving; automated reasoning; reasoning with uncertainty; machine learning; perceptrons and neural networks; Bayesian networks; hidden Markov models; and applications of these tools to areas such as image processing, computer vision, natural language understanding, music information retrieval, computer games, and robotics.

           A digital computer consists of many different hardware parts such as the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), read-only memory, (ROM), input/output (I/O) systems, multiprocessors, hard drives, and a variety of special function printed circuit boards. Computer architecture is concerned primarily with all these hardware components that make up a computer, as well as the structure and specification of the relations between all these components.

           Information technology is ubiquitous in our modern society. We all use this technology routinely to obtain information about almost anything in our daily lives. A database is a site that stores information or data in an organized way, together with supporting data structures and database languages that permit users to effect operations such as visualizing data, searching data, deleting old data, and inserting new data, in a secure way. In this course students learn the basic techniques for designing and managing databases useful in a variety of applications ranging from websites and banking systems, to video games.

           At the lowest level of data manipulation and computation in a computer, information is stored as binary sequences of ones and zeros. In order to make a computer execute any function, a program is required that manipulates these binary sequences. Such programs are written in a language called machine code or assembly language. Programming a computer in machine code is very cumbersome for human beings. However, humans are comfortable programming in high-level computer languages that resemble natural languages. A compiler is a computer program that translates (transforms) a program written in a high-level language to one in machine code. In this course students learn how to design state of the art compilers.

           Human beings communicate with computers using text, sound, and a variety of other modalities. Computer graphics deals with almost everything other than text and sound, and is therefore dominated by the visual aspects of computing. It is concerned with the design of algorithms, programs, graphics languages, graphics data structures, display devices, and systems for creating realistic images, and processing visual inputs such as photographs, drawings, movies, animations, or simulations.

           Have you ever wondered how the Internet or Facebook are able to support a billion simultaneous users? This course teaches students the design and implementation of such Internet-scale networks and networked systems. Students learn about the principles and techniques used to construct large scale networks and systems. Topics include routing protocols, network congestion control, wireless networking, overlay networks and applications, network security, and peer-to-peer systems. Upon completing this course students are able to initiate and critique research ideas, implement their own working systems, and evaluate such systems.To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation.  The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. We will draw examples primarily from the Internet.

           Can a digital computer solve any computation problem in principle? If it can, how long might it take to arrive at a solution? Indeed, what is meant by digital computation? These are the central questions that drive the theory of computation to shed light on the nature of computation. In this theoretical computer science course, a digital computer is considered as a precise mathematical model of computation. Such models are analyzed in terms of what they can and cannot do, and the computational complexity of the algorithms they use for solving a variety of important and fundamental problems.

           The capstone seminar provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD computer scientists and others in related fields. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth computer science capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.  Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

           The senior Capstone Experience in computer science requires students to engage in a long-term, mentored learning experience that cumulates in a piece of original research. The specific project is developed during junior year as part of the Capstone Seminar. Students may carry out either an applied or theoretical project. Students choosing to complete an applied research project may develop a significant software application applying an efficient algorithmic-based solution to a fundamental problem in any field such as health, arts, environment, science, engineering, business, or education. A senior thesis comprising either an applied or theoretical research project should fit standards of publication as outlined by a top-tier international journal or conference.

           This course offers students an introduction to how economists look at the world and approach problems. It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

           This course introduces students to the study of modern aggregate economics as applied to analyses of national economies in the long and short runs of time. The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.

           Examining both macro and micro aspects of the globalization of world economies, this course begins with the fundamentals of trade: comparative advantage, gains from trade, the price of factors of production, and the implications of labor and capital mobility. The second part of the course covers the role of money and finance in global economic activity. Topics include: the roles of the exchange rate; current and capital accounts as key variables in international economic relations; purchasing power parity and interest rate parity; the international effects of macro policy and government exchange rate policies; the role of oil exports in the world economy; and the role of international economic organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

           Building on the material in
           <em>
            Principles of Macroeconomics,
           </em>
           Intermediate Macroeconomics addresses in depth four foundational aspects of macroeconomic theory and policy: (1) theories of exogenous and endogenous growth in per capita incomes; (2) theories of fluctuations in output, employment and other macroeconomic aggregates with a focus on policy and other economic stimuli that can lead to booms and recessions; (3) determinants of inflation including capacity constraints, money, credit and expectations; (4) the aims, objectives and tools of monetary and fiscal policies and their relationship with financial intermediation and its regulation.

           This course introduces the major concepts and tools of modern microeconomic analysis. We study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers—firms and consumers—and coordinates their behavior. We will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes.

           This course examines the root causes of the financial crisis and the ensuing economic recession. We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

           Why is the average US American or European of today more than ten times richer than the average American or European one hundred years ago? And why is income of the average US American or European of today thirty times higher than the income of the average Sub-Saharan African? What explains “growth miracles” like modern day China? This course will review data about growth and development, as well as the theories that have been developed in order to explain empirical regularities observed in the data. An exploration of the link between growth, institutions and infrastructure, and evaluation of what types of policies are more growth-conducive, conclude the course.

           The course will focus on the interactions between the urbanization and economic development processes in sub-Sahara Africa. Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana's economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.

           The Near East was the cradle of civilization and one of the most vibrant regions of the world for thousands of years.  Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance.  This course explores this reversal in fortunate.  Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy?  What attempts have been made to catch up with the West?  Which have been successful?  How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region’s experience?

           This is a one-semester course on labor economics for undergraduate students. This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine  how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms?  How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation? The class will expose students to the basic theoretical models used by economists to tackle these issues. We will also survey evidence from empirical studies on these topics.

           Compared to most other countries the economic development of Argentina has been disastrous in the last 100 years. In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.

           How do individuals make decisions? What does it mean to be rational? How do rational individuals behave collectively? Can collective action be efficient? How stable are preferences?
           <br/>
           This course explores the extent, and limitations, of rationality in individual and collective decision making - both from a positive and normative perspective. It describes and characterizes the interaction between individual and collective choices on the market place and in firms, especially when markets fail. It investigates the interplay between the market mechanism and the democratic principle in the economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           The course introduces fundamental concepts, methods and paradigms of decision theory, general equilibrium theory and social choice theory. These are illustrated through short cases borrowed from the current economic, political and business scene. It examines how these tools might lead us to make better decisions; both as individuals or members of groups, and enables a better understanding of the dynamics of collective action.

           The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and some related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a long run perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises), and will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, putting the emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once the foundations are in place, the course will open up to a series of topics mixing themes – such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms – and in-depth study of major crises episodes – such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007-2008 and the Euro Crisis.

           This course offers a rigorous examination of the basic concepts and tools of modern finance. Students are introduced to cash flow analysis and present value, as well as basic concepts of return and risk, in order to understand how financial markets work and how financial instruments are valued. These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities, become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and their utilization by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk.

           This course introduces students to the field of behavioral economics or economic psychology. This is a field which seeks to insert non-standard assumptions about human preferences or beliefs into economic models. These assumptions are often motivated by psychological evidence. Throughout the course, we emphasize the interaction between theoretical predictions and empirical data. We explore various ways in which the predictions of the theory can be tested. The course is organized around four topics: social preferences, intertemporal discounting, prospect theory and heuristics and biases. The course requires a command of basic microeconomic theory and calculus. Some familiarity with econometric analysis of microeconomic data is also welcome.

           This course provides a rigorous introduction to modern microeconomic analysis. We start with a study of individual economic agents, including the basic models of consumer choice, producer choice, as well as decision-making under uncertainty and over time. We then introduce models where various consumers and firms interact with each other in markets. We study the Walrasian model of competitive equilibrium, and show when markets promote an efficient allocation of resources. We conclude by looking at various sources of market failures, including strategic behavior, asymmetric information, public goods, externalities, and incomplete markets.

           This course provides a formal study of aggregate, dynamic, stochastic, economic analysis, with attention paid first to the determination of the level of income, employment, and inflation. Next, the theories and the policies associated with inflation and hyperinflations, entitlement reforms, and the formation of optimal monetary and fiscal policies are examined. This course involves more formal analysis than that used in Intermediate Macroeconomics.

           International alliances for the purpose of military defense, partnerships of doctors or lawyers, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the members of clubs or social networks, are all examples of coalitions of agents with only partially converging interests, coordinating actions for their mutual benefit. Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those “coalitions”, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

           This course focuses on the economic analysis of major policy issues in energy and the environment. Emphasis is on market solutions to various problems and market limitations in the allocation of environmental resources. Energy issues focus on: OPEC and world oil markets; taxation and regulation of production and consumption; conservation of natural resources; and the transition to alternative energy sources. Environmental issues include policies to reduce pollution. Substantial attention is paid to global warming as it relates to the consumption of fossil fuels.

           This course develops students' abilities to understand business transactions and financial statements and to determine the most appropriate financial measures for those events. The underlying rationale for accounting practices is discussed and students assess their effectiveness in providing useful information for decision-making. Emphasis is placed on accounting practices that purport to portray corporate financial position, operating results, cash flows, manager performance, and financial strength.

           This course is about the economic activities of government, largely revenue raising and spending, in a global context. The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

           This course introduces students to the spatial aspects of economics, particularly the economic forces that shape the development of cities and regions. It examines the micro and macroeconomics underlying the structure of cities, why cities exist and why some grow more quickly than others. It also explores the economics of the location decision of individuals, and firms and resulting land-use patterns. Specific problems of urban/regional economies such as poverty, crime, and congestion are covered along with related policies.

           This course explores the contribution of microeconomic analysis to the normative issues surrounding the design of collective decision processes (voting rules, bargaining protocols), and the fair distribution and exploitation of scarce resources through prices or other market mechanisms. Attention is on the rigorous modeling of individual and collective welfare, and the logical difficulties of combining economic efficiency with the requirements of end-state and procedural justice. Applications include the Gini and other inequality indices, the Borda and Condorcet voting rules, the design of tax schedules,fair division of an inheritance, overcoming the tragedy of the commons, and more.

           Modern European and American finance has evolved into a highly liberalized, interconnected, and globalized system that depends on markets and banks as intermediaries between users and suppliers of capital. The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the "vicious downward cycle" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.

           The dynamics of the global banking and financial sector are central to economic performance and growth, and from time to time, financial markets and institutions are the scene of great turbulence. This course explores the process of national and global financial intermediation and its key elements involving commercial banking, investment banking, asset management and insurance. Individual classes deal with such topics as project finance, debt and equity new issues, mergers and acquisitions, financial derivatives and institutional funds management. Based on an understanding of the industry, additional classes focus on financial regulation and strategies of financial firms. The course is relatively non-technical and is intended to provide an overview of the global financial sector.

           This course examines the relationship between education and other social institutions in comparative context across national borders. What is the purpose of "school" and how has it be defined and redefined over time and in various cultures? Considers such educational ideas as IQ, merit, curriculum, tracking, equal access, and learning, as well as the bureaucratic organization of education. Analyzes the role of teachers, their expectations, and how they interact with students— particularly those of different genders, classes, and ethnic groups.

           The course provides an overview of major discussions and debates relative to gender and education in both "developed" and "developing" countries, and examines theoretical understandings of gender, and the intersection of gender, schooling, and global social justice. Key issues to be considered include: gender and education internationally, specifically the educational status of girls and women; empowerment and education; the role of boys and men in promoting gender equality; and the role of international donor agencies, the State, and NGOs. The course concludes by studying the role of teachers and innovative educational programs.

           This course compares the way that contemporary societies have addressed differences of race, ethnicity, class, religion, and gender in their state educational systems. We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies—and their schools—have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.—and vice versa—in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

           This course explores how state and non-state actors pursue peace and security, and the role of education in this process. We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.

           The course will examine how schools are implicated in the reproduction of inequality in countries throughout the world.  Although policy makers often regard education as a means to promote greater equality and opportunity, empirical evidence suggests that more often than not, a child’s background predicts how well they will perform in school and what types of employment opportunities will be available to them later in life.  However, some nations do a better job than others in using education to expand opportunity.  Understanding why some nations continue to have schools that struggle in their efforts to serve minorities and the poor children, and why other nations are experiencing greater success in this endeavor is the central aim of this course.  We will also consider the ways in which teachers, students, parents and their allies, have used educational settings and the educational process as a focal point for resistance to social and cultural reproduction, and various forms of oppression and discrimination. The role of social identities related to class, race, language and ethnicity in shaping the experiences of students and teachers in the reproduction process, will be a primary focus of the course readings and class discussions.

           This course explores how China has developed and transmitted nationalism through a range of educational institutions: schools, universities, museums, stadiums, and mass-media outlets. In course readings and papers, we will examine how the meanings of “nation” in China shifted across the past century. We will also intersperse our classes with visits to schools and other educational sites, to study contemporary trends and dilemmas in the teaching of nationalism. At the end of the course, we will ask what other national school systems might learn from China—and vice versa—in a globalizing world of flux, danger, and opportunity.

           The course introduces students to the history and culture of design and development philosophies and practices, the modern principles of technology design, and concepts of innovation, sourcing, shaping, and evaluating ideas and inventions. The labs emphasize experiential learning and innovation, and require students to use existing innovations to create and build prototypes of new technology/ design products, with real-life constraints. The course touches on social, cultural, economic, ethical, and other factors that shape engineering solutions and how to approach incorporating them in conjunction with problem solving and designing systems, components, or processes.

           This course introduces students to the field of mechanics through study of static equilibrium in two dimensions. Knowledge and understanding of static equilibrium is essential for future study of dynamics, robotics, fluid mechanics, astrodynamics, and vibrations. The methods, techniques, theory, and application of equilibrium in the solution of engineering problems are presented for two-dimensional systems. Students have the opportunity for extensive practice in applying these principles. Topics covered include collinear forces, coincident forces, general two-dimensional equilibrium, moments and torques, the method of sections, the method of joints, analysis of frames and machines, and Coulomb friction.

           Conservation laws play a fundamental role in the analysis of engineering problems by providing a framework to derive relationships between various physical properties of closed and open systems and control volumes. This course aims to introduce the students to these laws namely—the conservation of mass, conservation of force and linear momentum, conservation of torque and angular momentum, conservation of energy, conservation of chemical species, and conservation of charge—that are derived in integral forms. Selected case studies are used to demonstrate the application of these laws for the simplification of complex engineering problems. In addition, this course also helps the students develop a deeper understanding of the concepts of work and heat.

           This module provides a rigorous introduction to topics in digital logic design mostly focusing on combinational circuits but also touching upon basic concepts in sequential circuits. Introductory topics include: classification of digital systems, number systems and binary arithmetic, error detection and correction, and switching algebra. Combinational design analysis and synthesis topics include: logic function optimization, arithmetic units such as adders and subtractors, and control units such as decoders and multiplexers. A brief overview of sequential circuits by introducing basic memory elements such as flip-flops, and state diagrams concludes the module.

           Experimental methods is presented as a process of investigation starting with an observation, leading to one or more hypotheses tested by experiments involving measurements, collection of results, analysis and conclusion. Students are first introduced to the historical significance of experimental discoveries, the importance of experimental design and measurement. Key examples are discussed. The importance of measurements, errors, uncertainty and its justification will be discussed in detail and students will learn how to estimate, use and report uncertainties. Techniques to compare, analyze and report different measurements are studied. Students are introduced to error propagation rules, random and systematic errors and standard deviation as the uncertainty in a single measurement.

           This module provides an introduction to topics in signals and systems, covering analytical techniques for analyzing, characterizing and synthesizing engineering systems. Systems approaches where the entire system or each of the sub-systems are considered as single units are introduced. The focus will mostly be on discrete time systems while basic concepts in continuous time systems are also visited. Introductory topics include: sinusoids, phase and time shift, and complex exponentials. Operations on sinusoidal signals include addition of signals with the same frequency via the phasor addition rule, conversion between time-shift and phase, and addition of signals with different frequencies via the introduction of the frequency spectrum concept. Topics on discrete time systems include: FIR and IIR filtering, impulse response, causality, linearity, time invariance, and convolution. Time and frequency domain representations of systems and conversions between these representations are also studied. Z-transform domain, the concept of poles and zeros, stability and their relevance to the time and frequency domains are also covered. A brief overview of continuous time signals concludes the module.

           This course provides an introduction to computer-aided design using solid modeling. Students learn to create solid object models using extrusions, revolutions, and swept paths, and learn to modify parts using cutting, patterns, fillets, chamfers, and other techniques. Assemblies of multiple parts will be used to demonstrate the need for geometric tolerances, and students will spend a large portion of class in hands-on use of software tools. The labs emphasize experiential learning of CAD concepts and applications using software tools.

           This course introduces students to vibrations of rigid bodies supported by an elastic component (i.e. simple spring-mass systems). The course covers simple harmonic motion in free, transient, and forced vibration situations, and will use both analytical and numerical solution approaches.  Damped vibration will be considered, along with a brief introduction to systems of coupled masses.  Practical applications of this material include vibration isolation, suspension systems, and active vibration control.

            This course introduces students to the principles of rigid dynamics. The course covers both kinematic (geometric aspects of motion) and kinetic (analysis of forces causing motion) approaches. The first section of the course focuses on particle dynamics, with rigid body dynamics covered in the second section. The applications of these methods to engineering problems are presented, and students have the opportunity for extensive practice in applying these principles. Specific topics include the following: rectilinear and curvilinear motion, equations of motion for a system of particles, work and energy for a system of particles, linear impulse and momentum for a system of particles, angular momentum, relative and absolute motion analysis, rigid body rotation, and general 2D rigid body motion.

           Students study the basic theory and equations involved in the finite element analysis (FEA) for stimulating behavior of materials and structures. Topics include use of shape functions, numerical integration, assembly of finite elements into a structure, and solution of the resulting system of equations. The course emphasizes both theory and application of modeling for simulation. Students also learn to recognize modeling errors and inconsistencies that could lead to either inaccurate or invalid results.

           The goal of the Capstone Design Project is to provide students with a major design experience that leverages the knowledge and skills acquired through their undergraduate studies and co-curricular experiences. Its structure includes a process of design with measurable metrics, and incorporation of appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Emphasis is placed on clearly framing the design problem and following the design process to result in an optimized design solution. Students are encouraged to build prototypes of their designs and seek validation of their solutions through simulations and experiments, as appropriate.

            The Capstone Project aims to be collaborative and trans-disciplinary across several engineering streams. The emphasis is on students applying the design process to solve real-world problems in a 21st century, global context.  The projects address engineering and technology topics that overlap with the sciences, social sciences, liberal arts or business. The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester. The senior year culminates in a comprehensive project report and design review by a committee of faculty and other professionals.

           Capstone Seminar (ENGR-AD-400), Capstone Design Project I (ENGR-AD-401) and Capstone Design Project II (ENGR-AD-402) collectively offer the engineering capstone experience to seniors. Capstone Seminar (Fall) and Capstone Design Project I (Fall) are two credits each. Capstone seminar focuses on skill building, project management and Ethics. Capstone Design Project I focus on different aspects of the capstone project such as problem definition and creating the design solution. Capstone Design Project II in spring consists of two, seven week modules. The design solution proposed in Capstone Design Project I is implemented in the first module. It is tested and validated in Module II.

           The goal of the Capstone Design Project is to provide students with a major design experience that leverages the knowledge and skills acquired through their undergraduate studies and co-curricular experiences. Its structure includes a process of design with measurable metrics, and incorporation of appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Emphasis is placed on clearly framing the design problem and following the design process to result in an optimized design solution. Students are encouraged to build prototypes of their designs and seek validation of their solutions through simulations and experiments, as appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Capstone Project aims to be collaborative and trans-disciplinary across several engineering streams. The emphasis is on students applying the design process to solve real-world problems in a 21st century, global context.  The projects address engineering and technology topics that overlap with the sciences, social sciences, liberal arts or business. The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester. The senior year culminates in a comprehensive project report and design review by a committee of faculty and other professionals.
          </p>
          <p>
           Capstone Seminar (ENGR-AD-400), Capstone Design Project I (ENGR-AD-401) and Capstone Design Project II (ENGR-AD-402) collectively offer the engineering capstone experience to seniors. Capstone Seminar (Fall) and Capstone Design Project I (Fall) are two credits each. Capstone seminar focuses on skill building, project management and Ethics. Capstone Design Project I focus on different aspects of the capstone project such as problem definition and creating the design solution. Capstone Design Project II in spring consists of two, seven week modules. The design solution proposed in Capstone Design Project I is implemented in the first module. It is tested and validated in Module II.

           An intensive and practical production workshop introducing the fundamental principles of storytelling through sound, image, and visual sequencing. Using stills and video, integrating theory and practice, students learn the essentials of cinematic language from composition to editing. Themes of Sense of Place, Portrait, and Memoir are explored in the context of projects assigned. Diegetic and non-diegetic sound, and/or voiceover supplement the visual storytelling. Students work individually and in collaboration. Goals of the course include an understanding of professional protocol and the dialogue of critique. Four lab sessions outside of class are mandatory.

           This course introduces students to the rich and diverse history of film within the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia (MENASA) regions as a background for understanding some of the complexities of contemporary film and new media, particularly in the UAE.  By examining pre-cinematic artistic practices, aesthetic traditions, cinematic styles, political economies of media, and social change, the course provides a context for understanding productions from major industries in Cairo, Chennai, and Mumbai alongside work by independent filmmakers and new media collectives from throughout the regions.  Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

           Whether narrative or non-narrative, the visceral, emotional, and intellectual power of film and new media depends on understanding the sounds and images within the context of conventions and expectations. This course analyzes and puts into practice principles of different forms of dramatic and dynamic writing: classical, episodic, and parametric in narrative and documentary; rhythmic and contrapuntal in experimental film; episodes and attractions for web platforms; interactive and auto-generative in new media. The course includes field trips as a study in location and place. Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

           A workshop designed to develop short screenplays from concept to structure to final draft. Topics include theme, character, research, story, conflict, dialogue, and script editing. The course aims to make a connection between the ancient traditions of the oral storyteller and the professional practice of the contemporary screenwriter when pitching to producers. Screenings and discussions focus on classical and contemporary examples of the short film from a variety of genres, traditions, and cultures. All students complete two short screenplays.

           In this hands-on course, we explore the vocabulary of camera movement and the dramatic impact of the long, single take. Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

           This course focuses on designing and executing the visual elements of a film. Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them. We shoot exercises in the classroom or on location.

           This course considers digital reformulations of the practice of cinema. What happens when film spectators become players of videogames, actors in locative media, or users of new media? What happens to the pleasures (cinephilia) and vulnerabilities (deterioration) of celluloid when we consider glossy compression formats and VOD (video on demand) distribution? How do the notions of virtual reality and artificial life intersect with “virtual migration” and “gold farming?” What can be learned about CGI (computer generated images) in relation to special effects achieved “in camera” or the optical printer? Students analyze an array of new media objects from around the world, as well as produce/ construct and distribute their own.

           World cinema typically has been studied as a collection of national traditions. What happens when the history of cinema is reframed within a set of regional, transnational, and global traditions? Students use film theory and close analysis to rethink the history of world cinema with particular emphasis on post-1960 Hollywood and New Wave films.

           This course offers an historical/critical overview of one of the most influential film movements in the history of cinema—the French New Wave. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement’s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinéma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cinéma Vérité (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

           In an art world saturated by men, do women offer another way of seeing? Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books and iconic images will be screened and studied. Students will write and critique, and look to their cultural milieu to make an image based project, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

           This course reveals how film style (cinematography, mise-en-scène, and editing) informs how we understand and emotionally respond to films. We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-scène and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

           This course treats the theory, practice, and analysis of film adaptations of novels across a broad spectrum that includes novels by such figures as Defoe, Steinbeck, Nabokov, Flaubert, and Clarice Lispector. Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the “transtextuality” theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

           This course explores temporal stages of post-classical American cinema from the 1960s new wave to the new millennium global Hollywood. It also maps historically significant films on three broadly thematic stages: mind, society, and culture. Students acquire psychological, sociopolitical, and cultural perspectives in this regard, while learning about historical shifts, major genres and auteurs, and key issues on industry and technology. The course aims at shedding new synthetic light on the modern history of the world’s most powerful cinema.

           This course investigates the relationship of cinema and war from the early 20th century to the present. From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war’s many violences are represented; the filmmakers’ circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.

           This course is designed to develop techniques and skills in generating ideas for short films that are shot on digital video and edited on nonlinear editing software. It will focus on strong visualization of story and camera techniques, as opposed to dialogue-based work. Students will develop skills in the elements of visual storytelling through the process of storyboarding and creating shot lists, then working in small crews to direct and shoot the projects. Students will gain knowledge of new photographic techniques, moving the camera dynamically, and the ways in which the craft of editing and sound design can be used to support story.

           A practical introduction to creating compelling stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. The academic study of classic documentaries is combined with craft training and a review of documentary film styles. Practical exercises are assigned weekly. Working collaboratively in small production teams, each student completes a short documentary portrait. The course includes the introduction of digital filmmaking fundamentals: lighting, camera, and sound recording. The creative role of the editor is also emphasized. Students learn to understand how pacing, transitions, cuts, and continuity can enhance a documentary film.

           Exploring the interview in film, radio, television, print, and new media, this class considers a range of theoretical and practical approaches to the shaping of questions, the interviewer/interviewee relationship, character, and constructing an argument. Readings include Plato, Deleuze, and Studs Terkel and the class examines the approaches of Errol Morris, Michael Moore, Sadie Benning, David Frost, James Agee, Oprah Winfrey, and others. Class projects investigate these techniques from both a practical and theoretical perspective.

           Traditional broadcast media (television and radio) are in a time of transition, pushed in new directions by the increasing ease of producing compelling material, and by the interactive and social nature of the Internet. Blogs and other Internet-based social networks have given rise to an audience that is eager to engage with and participate in the creation of media. The goal of this course is to introduce students to new technologies and methods for creating participatory media and making it available to the public. Students develop new ideas for helping this transition along both on the Internet and in the traditional broadcast space.

           This course is designed to give student filmmakers more authority in applying techniques to telling a story visually. These techniques include choice of locations, casting, color palette and production design, camera work, lighting, mise-en-scène, editing, and sound design. Emphasis is given to translating a script into techniques that create a coherent style. The course emphasizes weekly exercises (outside of class, with digital camera), critical readings, and close reading of clips from films produced around the world from the early 1900s to today.

           This practical workshop offers students hands-on insight into the process of creating drama in a film using the human capacity to respond emotionally to a fictional situation. Students learn how to direct films that have a precise screenplay and a well-constructed plot in a way that brings non-actors to act out a story without being aware that they are being directed according to a pre-written script.

           This course examines migrations of the short format from the silent era through its serialization as episodes in long-format narrative, such as television series and video games. The course explores the aesthetics and politics of looking from peep shows and television flows into video-on-demand and webcam surveillance, focusing professional and nonprofessional productions. Topics may include: exhibition platforms from nickelodeons to social media, music videos, Brazilian and Mexican telenovelas, Indian mythologicals, Nollywood video-films, Ramadan serials, Korean dramas, video mashups and GIFs, console video games, vlogs, global talent-show and reality-television franchises, and animated series including Freej.

           This seminar is devoted to the interrelated issues of colonialism, postcolonialism, comparative race, and multiculturalism as apprehended through diverse disciplines, media, and colonial histories. Throughout our focus is comparative, transnational and trans- disciplinary, mingling the theories and methods of media studies, literary studies, philosophy, and social studies. The goal is to reflect in a polycentric way on a multicultural world still shaped by the legacies of (post) colonialism, as reflected, refracted, translated, and resisted by the media.

           The course provides a review of current documentaries and a comparison with those made in earlier decades. We examine influential works such as Robert Flaherty’s Nanook of the North, propaganda films, cinéma vérité, social and educational documentaries, the personal documentary, re-enactment and dramatization, experimental works, and the unique voices of artists such as Errol Morris. The course explores the different genres of documentary filmmaking and identifies the specific elements employed in the context of their time, their objective, and their audience. The final project: a 5-7–minute documentary portrait of “a character work.” This course also includes a final exam.

           The emphasis of the course is on storytelling. The class has two components: lectures, in which concepts are discussed and demonstrated and work-in-progress sessions in which students screen and critique each others work. Students work toward the completion of a short film. Seniors are encouraged to edit their Capstone films.

           This course examines emergent “imagine networks” (anti-globalization activists, youtubers, second lifers) fostered by new media technologies and applications. What is the changing relationship between the local and global and how do “global” phenomena affect national and personal identities? Readings are historical, political, and literary.

           While its total revenue stream is only the size of a medium-size Hollywood studio, the global audience for Bollywood film is larger than that of Hollywood, and both are 100 years old. The course explores the character and development of its unique aesthetics and idioms as they responded to the radical social changes wrought by the liberation of India from colonialism and the development of technological modernity. Topics include the early cinema of Phalke, the coming of sound, the golden age of the 1950s, the development of the new wave, Bengali Cinema, the figure of Ambitab Bachchan and the Indian star system, and the emergence of modern Bollywood as a domain of media synergy and globalization.

           What does it mean to create interactive cinema? What are its limits and possibilities? Are we talking about cinema that is narrative, formal, symbolic, or vestigial? How does interactivity impact narrative perception, rhythm, and arc? Is the interface user- driven or machine-driven? Multilinear or singular? Screen or object based? Do we want to work for our stories? Is it possible to make profound or emotional narrative work in a multilinear or interactive environ- ment? The creation and evaluation of work in this class pivots on the notion of narrative perception: a viewer’s desire to actively make story out of represented moments, from Chaplin’s silent movies to U.S. Army recruitment ads to De Kooning’s paintings of women.

           If one vector of globalization is accelerated homogenization—McDonaldization, Hollywoodization, Googlization—another vector is expanded diversity of media: amateur, ambient, activist, commercial, documentary, experimental, indigenous, locative, and tactical media. This course examines new media ecologies of digital technologies and distributed networks deployed in production, distribution, exhibition, and reception in Africa, Latin America, indigenous nations, Middle East, North America, South Asia, and through transnational collaborations.

           How do technology and new media change the way we create, consume, and distribute video? The goal of this class is to provide an overview of video and its relevance to present-day new media. Topics covered include aesthetics and concepts, camera use, basic editing in Final Cut Pro, DVD Studio Pro, and an introduction to interactive video software such as Jitter. Through a series of weekly experiments and assignments, students gain experience with video blogging, short format documentary style, and interactive video installations. Previous video experience is not required and experimentation is highly encouraged.

           This course is designed for students with an interest in exploring a specific subject through the documentary genre. By focusing on a single issue, the course aims to cover many points of view and to provide a foundation of knowledge, vocabulary, and insight about both the subject matter raised by the films and the techniques and skills of good documentary filmmaking. Through frequent screenings and discussions, and a required reading list, the students study specific subjects in depth. Both classical and contemporary films are shown. Specific examples of fields of study include: civil rights, human rights, the environment, biographies, and societes at war.

           Fact may or may not be stranger than fiction, but invariably both exert strong influences in creating narrative. The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures.  We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

           In this intensive course, Film and New Media majors will produce their Capstone short films. This course expands and nurtures the student’s individual and unique voice as a film-maker. With the emphasis on emotional responses to situations and scenes, we will learn how to translate scripts into shooting scripts and shot lists. We will explore different approaches in casting and working with actors and cover topics such as script breakdown, budgeting, location managing, and scheduling. Each student will learn the different roles and responsibilities of a film production crew by participating in all productions.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines in the humanities, the natural and the social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant.

           What is global history?  How does it differ from world history? International history? Transnational history? And why has writing global histories become a new intellectual imperative for historians today? This gateway course for the history program provides students with skills to answer these questions. It challenges them to examine when categories like the nation and civilization enhance or inhibit historical understanding, and to consider alternatives to identifying meaningful units of place and space for historical inquiry.

           What is history? This course offers an introduction to theories and practices of history. Students engage with a wide array of sources (written documents, material artifacts, oral histories, and visual culture), are introduced to methods of archival research, and learn to critically assess the influence of such elements as narrative, rhetoric, underlying interests and perspective on the reliability of historical accounts.

           This course offers an overview of global environmental history with a focus on the period from 1500 C.E. to the present—a time marked by a dramatic intensification in the use of land, water, and energy resources around the world. Our central goal is to understand the relationship between globalization, natural resource use, and environmental change, and to explain how this relationship unfolded (and continues to unfold) differently in major world regions. This course assumes no background knowledge in either world or environmental history.

           This course explores the history of medicine from a global perspective. We study both the circulation and exchange of ideas, texts, and materia medica among different regions, and explore how healing was differently practiced and experienced in regions characterized by distinctive disease ecologies, social relations, and cultural understandings of illness and the body. In teasing out the relationship between "global" and "local", we probe important questions about the agency of non-western and lower-class people in shaping the history of medicine, including "western" biomedicine.

           This course explores the artistic and intellectual avant-gardes, counter-cultures and protest movements of the 1960s and the early 1970s from a global perspective, assessing their impact on individual identities, social and gender hierarchies, domestic politics and international relations during the Cold War. It traces the history of the various protest movements and explores a plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large.

In a world dominated by transnational organizations, historians have begun to look beyond nation-states and to re-evaluate the important place of empires in world history. Despite different geographies and cultures, empires of similar size and complexity emerged across the entire fertile Eurasian landmass in the second half of the first millennium BCE. Each in its own way, the Achaemenid Persian, Roman, and Qin-Han Chinese empires established the legacy of imperial rule that later Iranian, European, and Chinese statesmen and intellectuals felt compelled to embrace or self-consciously reject. By comparing the histories of these three ancient empires, we will see what they had in common, how they differed, and whether they can still help us understand global conflict and cooperation.

           The course explores the phenomenology, theory, and practice of revolution from the French Revolution to the fall of Soviet communism. It seeks to answer three fundamental questions: what are the underlying causes of revolution; how and why do revolutions migrate or undergo cultural translation; and to what extent have revolutions become the catalyst for societal (dis/re)organization in modernity. Readings include historical documents as well as theoretical works by Burke, Marx, Lenin, Lukacs, Arendt, Fanon, Debray, and Marcuse.

Attention is given to the foundations of community, the changing uses of public space, the appearance of new strategies of urban planning, and the contested process of defining the “modern” within a specific local culture.

           The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century.  It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead.  Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution.  Large portions of France lay in ruins and England’s wealth shattered.  The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict.  We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact.  And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.

           This course explores how to write histories of Islam as a global religion.  Its focus is on the wider Indian Ocean world – aptly characterized as the cradle of globalization– where trade has long connected a vast region stretching from the Mediterranean to the South China Sea and where most Muslims have historically resided. The course readings include empirically rich scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as selected primary sources.  By engaging critically with these materials, we will work towards developing a nuanced understanding of the changing nature of Muslim ideas, subjectivities, identities, institutions, and practices in distinct, but interconnected and interwoven, localities over time. Throughout, we will also necessarily probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam – interrogating especially the limits and legacies of conventional European colonial and US imperial ethnic and area studies paradigms.

This course explores a range of topics from the Indian Ocean trading world; protoindustrialization in pre-colonial India; the East India Company to developmentalist theories and proindustrialization policies; nationalism, decoloni- zation, and political economy; and neo-liberalism.

           Through literature, this course acquaints students with major issues and questions relating to Africa’s development from early to contemporary times. Questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing morality, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities are all examined regionally and over time.

           Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, South Asia is home to over a billion people, and is the site of a richly interconnected history with regions around the wider Indian Ocean world. The course explores this history, with a focus on understanding major political, economic, cultural, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people and shaped the nature of collective identities (religious, caste, class, gender, regional, linguistic, ethnic and national) over time. Learning how collective identities have been produced historically will ultimately enable us to appraise and navigate competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in South Asia and the wider Indian Ocean world today.

           Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa.  Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development.  A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic).  By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.

           America's Wars, Past and Present:
           <br/>
           This is a course taught in wartime – however invisible -- about wars. We shall begin by considering the post-1945 wars of the 20th century and then move on to discuss the series of wars that have marked the 21st century.  The history, political uses, memory and forgetting of the Korean and Vietnam Wars will be the subject of the first part of the course. The ongoing influence of those wars on contemporary politics will occupy the second part of the course. The way Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm) was fought and reported upon was shaped by the specific understanding the administration of George H.W. Bush had of the Vietnam War. The 2nd war in the Gulf (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and the war in Afghanistan were shaped by the outcome of the first Gulf War. But they were also fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies that were used by those who supported and those who opposed the war.  The course will examine these analogies with some care. There are two connected questions: can history teach? What does it teach?

           The goal of this course is to examine Chinese society and culture through the lens of the consumption of food and drugs and to elucidate the central role played at different times by food and drugs in Chinese culture and its representations. We examine the role of food and drugs, especially opium, in Chinese social, cultural, economic, and political history, with an emphasis on the pre-modern period. Topics may include the relationship of health and diet; food in religious and ritual practice, gastronomy, consumption and the material culture of food and drugs, restaurants and catering; famine; imperial dining practices; tobacco smoking; opium smoking, cultivation, and elimination; the Opium Wars; and food, drugs, and identity, including the global association of China with food and with opium.

           This course examines empire building and cultural encounters in the East Asia region, comparing the character of empires across time and space, as well as the politics of human diversity. We look at the nuts and bolts of empire building, as well as how cultures of conquest shape identity (especially ethnicity and gender) and regional geopolitics.

           This course examines topics in the history of the environment in China, as well as problems in the ethnology of environmental history. We begin by inquiring into the question of “China’s Environmental Crisis,” viewed from a variety of historical perspectives. We then turn to alternative ways of asking questions about the “environment” in China. Topics include cultural perceptions of nature, human-animal relations, the politics of water rights and pollution, the ecology of disease, the concept of biodiversity, and many other factors contributing to the transformation of nature into a shared and contested resource.

           This course introduces students to the major themes of African history through film, literature, and music. Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans’ responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

           The course explores the economic, political, and cultural asymmetries of the long symbiosis when Europe was divided at the Pyrenees into a Muslim and a Christian sphere. Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) was religiously tolerant, culturally rich, and economically robust. Carolingian and post-Carolingian Europe were economically retarded and culturally impoverished. By the beginning of the 12th century, a Christian reconquest overwhelmed the Muslim Andalusia. Nevertheless, an Indian summer of interfaith collaboration of Christian, Muslim, and Jew persisted.

           Introduced by merchant activity in the 8th century C.E., by the 15th century Islam had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan, and was the foundation for significant urban development in East Africa. This course examines both the impact of 17th-19th-century Islamic reform in West Africa and the transatlantic slave trade, and the influence and legacy of African Muslims exported to the Americas via the slave trade. Finally, we consider the contemporary Muslim experience in both Africa and the Americas.

           What makes ideas historical? How do ideas travel beyond their originating contexts and become embedded in different temporal, linguistic, and cultural settings, often with vastly unexpected consequences? How do intellectuals feature as cultural agents and producers of ideology in such processes? The course explores these and other issues by following the trajectories of some influential ideas articulated in German letters during the “Long Nineteenth Century” (1789–1914) and seeks to explain the diverse European and global legacies they inspired during and after this period. Focusing on the interplay between theory and practice, the course investigates how such ideas changed in the course of their dissemination, appropriation, and re-interpretation, in ways that radically transformed the modern world.

           This course covers the basic immigration, ethnic, and racial history of the US from colonial times through the present. Which population groups arrived when, and with what political and cultural consequences for themselves and for other groups? How has public and private authority dealt with ethnic and racial diversity in the most conspicuous of the immigrant-receiving nations in the world, and one with egalitarian aspirations? What ideas about diversity and cosmopolitanism have developed in this American context?

           Rethinking the traditional narratives of U.S. history, this course explores America’s past from a transnational and global perspective. Chronologically, it covers America's interaction with the wider world from the earliest European settlements to the Spanish-American War of 1898, examining the Colonial Period, the Revolutionary War, the founding of the republic, the War of 1812, westward expansion, as well as the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, and Reconstruction. Readings and classroom discussions focus on the major political, economic, and cultural forces that shaped the process of American nation-building, reevaluating the allegedly "exceptional" elements of U.S. history in relation to networks, identities, and events that transcended the nation-state.

           This course explores some of Latin America’s most significant social and political events during the Cold War: the democratic election in 1970 of a Marxist president in Chile, his overthrow by a military coup d’état in 1973, and the installation of a military regime led by General Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1989. During this period, Chile attracted the world’s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies.
          </p>
          <p>
           This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile's social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile’s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet’s regime.

Examines the background in Europe leading to the Crusades; the social, political, and economic situation in the eastern Mediterranean before the Crusades; the fortunes of the Crusader (Latin) Kingdom of Jerusalem; and the reactions of Europeans and Easterners to one another. Examines and reevaluates the legacy of the Crusades on both the Eastern and the Western worlds.

           TThis course examines the interconnected histories, cultures, and societies of Central Asia and the Middle East. It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. We will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. We will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalisms, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women’s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.

           This intellectual history course examines the emergence of Renaissance humanism, particularly in Florence from Petrarch to Pico and Machiavelli, by examining the political and cultural foundations of humanism, the turn toward Ancient Greece and Rome, and the establishment of a human-centered point of view in poetry, philosophy, religious thought, and art. What picture of the human being emerged with this turn? How did the turn toward the Classics contribute to the development of modern humanism? How was this humanism itself taken up in the Enlightenment and the development of modern education systems, and what remains of humanism today?

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. In the tutorial, students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty director to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a senior thesis. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the senior thesis. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines in the arts, and the natural and social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant.

           Abu Dhabi contains many worlds, from five-star hotel restaurants to South Asian migrant workers eating on the job. This course uses food to explore the daily life of a global city in the Middle East. The course combines intensive reading and writing assignments with reporting and field trips. With Abu Dhabi as their beat, students explore the role of markets; traditional bedouin cuisine and the rituals of eating it; the hidden lives of food producers and growers; the cuisine of exile; the business of food; edible geography; and other topics drawing on anthropology, economics, culture, politics, and urban studies. Students participate in hands-on experiences like visits to local markets and restaurants. Each student are expected to find, report, and write a feature article about a food-related location in Abu Dhabi. Readings range from medieval Arabic culinary manuals and classics of cultural anthropology to contemporary food reporting and literature, with an emphasis on the Middle East.

           This seminar investigates the state’s power to punish. We read foundational works from philosophy, sociology, political science, and law to explore why states punish, how they punish, and whom they punish. We focus on the modern American approach to punishment, including its use of mass incarceration and the death penalty. We analyze U.S. Supreme Court cases in light of the fundamental purposes of punishment, and compare penal practices around the world. Though subject to change, activities outside the classroom may include attending arraignment court, observing a sentencing hearing, and visiting a correctional facility.

           The course addresses the norms that govern states in their legal relations with each other, including those that affect how states treat persons within their territories. The focus is on understanding the basic sources of international law (treaties and customary law) as well as the actors that influence their development, interpretation, and enforcement (especially governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and international courts). Topcics include: the role and function of the United Nations, international responsibility and the protection of aliens and their property, the regulation of the use of force, and recent developments in international criminal law (including the establishment and function of the International Court of Justice), and the impact of the "human rights revolution." Select class outings and visitors to the class, based in Buenos Aires, introduce students to the regional implications and applications of international law.

           Climate change will be a foremost theme that will influence financial activities, and policy and legal framework for years to come. In a noticeably short time span, climate change has become a global challenge calling for collective action. Climate change law is emerging as a new legal discipline. Students in this course will explore how climate change law relates to other areas of law and how climate change has elicited rulemaking process at the international, regional, national and local levels. The course will encourage students to identify the climate change policy issues in state and international laws. Students will also study how international law and international relations influence current national laws and policies. The class will be invited to study the negotiation process, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun and Durban Agreements. The class will then proceed to evaluate the various legal tools that are available at national and international level to address climate change, including cap-and-trade, carbon taxation, command-and-control regulation, litigation, securities disclosures, and voluntary actions. The class will also examine energy and climate change nexus and the roles of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and carbon capture and sequestration. The course will pay special attention to the role of developing countries in the emerging international climate change regime and negotiation strategies of G77+China in Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Doha, Warsaw, and upcoming UNFCCC conference in Peru in December 2014.

           Social Entrepreneurship is a dynamic and growing field which may be defined in various ways, yet at its core is about using evolved business thinking and practices to change the world. This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a "deep dive" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be "change makers."

           Major texts in critical theory from Plato to Derrida are considered in relation to literary practice. The first half of the course focuses on four major types of critical theory: mimetic, ethical, expressive, and formalist. The second half turns to 20th-century critical schools, such as Russian and American formalism, archetypal criticism, structuralism, psychoanalytic criticism, feminism, reader-response theory, deconstruction, and historicism.

           This course introduces students to two major genres of literature—epic and drama—and to fundamental terms and critical methods employed by literary scholars. Topics to be investigated include: the relationship between text and context, close vs. distant reading, the nature of authorship; genre; the interplay of local, national, regional, and world modes of categorization; translation; book history; and the relationship between literature and other forms of art. Each unit of the course is constructed around an anchoring text or texts that will be contextualized both historically and generically through a wide range of primary and secondary readings. For fall 2014, the anchoring texts are Ferdowsi’s The Shahnameh, Virgil’s The Aeneid, and Sophocles’ Oedipus the King.

           This course develops students’ understanding of the central questions and problems that drive literary studies. Drawing upon a long history of theoretical approaches, the course considers such questions as: What is literature? What is a text? What does a literary critic or scholar do? What does it mean to read literature in translation? How does language shape meaning? How do we construct meaning from a text—and why does that meaning matter? And, crucially: what is at stake in why we ask and how we answer these questions? This class will engage these questions by reading widely, from primary theoretical and critical texts to examples from print and digital material, and by exploring particular practices of literary scholarship—from archival research to work in digital humanities—that offer necessary skills for effective critical practice.

           Humanism—which in some regions coincides with Renaissance—was a cultural movement initiated in Italy in the 14th century, spreading all over Europe until it reached its end in the 17th century. Its programmatic energy derived from the desire to remember something that seemed to have been obliterated and forgotten in the course of the Middle Ages, i.e. pagan antiquity. Basing their European—national and transnational—identities on something much older than Christianity, scholars (poets, painters, architects, composers, and philosophers) revived and developed scientifically the Greek and Roman legacy and laid the founding stones for Enlightenment and Modernity.

           In postcolonial literature, representation and revolution intersect, as writers reinvent literary forms and seek to reconceive colonialism, nationalism, and modernity. The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how “the Empire writes back”; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

           Globalization, the acceleration of transportation and information technologies, transforms the experience of distance, producing perceptions of proximity and inter-connectedness across nations. It foregrounds movement and simultaneity, blurring boundaries between “real” and “virtual” worlds. Through texts emphasizing home, homelessness, migration, diaspora, transnationalism, tourism, the course examines how literature, film, games, graphic novels, and new media guide readers in this new landscape by charting new concepts of space and place, community, and global citizenship.

           This workshop introduces the basic elements of poetry, fiction, and personal narrative with in-class writing, take-home reading and writing assignments, and substantive discussions of craft. The course is structured as a workshop, which means that students receive feedback from their instructor and their fellow writers in a roundtable setting, and they should be prepared to offer their classmates responses to their work.

           This course presents a comparative approach to the formation and development of European literary traditions from the late eighteenth century to the present day, with an emphasis on fiction and poetry as embodiments of modernity. We will explore the ways in which authors reflect on their experience of modernity with stories that present mysterious situations, uncanny encounters, and events that defy rationality. Their texts present a discomfort with a reality that is experienced as modern and, therefore, discomforting and threatening. Particular attention will be paid to the specific national and historical setting of each text. This course functions as both an introduction to post-Enlightenment European literature and an in-depth study of the concept of modernity. We will be discussing the following texts, among others: Brothers Grimm, “Bluebeard;” Coleridge, “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner;” Hoffmann, “The Sandman;” Baudelaire,

           This course explores the craft of and the market for literary translation. Why do some translators aim for familiarity and others for estrangement? What is gained and lost in a text’s cultural relocation? Translation, and translation projects such as Abu Dhabi’s Kalima, play a pivotal role in shaping intercultural exchange and globalizing literary markets and canons. The course involves conversations with translators and authors in Abu Dhabi and abroad. Case studies include The Epic of Gilgamesh, the quatrains of Khayyam, sonnets of Shakespeare and Camões, and modern and contemporary works by Borges, Pessoa, Saramago, Kundera, Ondaatje, and Paz Soldan.

It traces how this malleable form has served different historical moments, cultural contexts, and political ideologies, and asks why Magic Realism has been privileged as a global form. Materials include art, art criticism, film, and fiction from Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.

           This course considers travel and geography as a theme in pre-modern Arabic and Islamicate literary cultures from the 7th century to the 19th century. During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers’ accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation,  circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

           To what extent do nationalist traditions of the novel break down in the period after the Second War? This course examines the ways in which the U.S. novel has been marked by two conflicting trajectories: first, the emergence of powerful novels by writers who belong to historically marginalized traditions; second, a growing sense that the novel has become a residual form, no longer dominant among the various forms of narrative that U.S. culture makes available. The course explores the ways in which the novel dramatizes the multicultural, transnational, and cosmopolitan experiences that mark the 21st century, with an emphasis on the ways in which U.S. writers have sought to engage global traditions, past and present.

           This course explores foundational myths and fairy tales, from the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh to contemporary re-envisionings of Bluebeard and Cinderella. Long before print and the coming of the book, every society has told stories to tackle deep questions: about the human place in the world, the origins of natural phenomena, the meaning of love and war, the mystery of death. This form of literature has been called the work of “reasoned imagination” (Borges). Readings from classic works (Ovid, Apuleius, as well as the above) help inspire original writing projects and tales that draw on the participants’ own cultures.

           This course focuses on works that have been considered classics of American Literature. It examines the various factors that lead a work to be canonized and the politics of inclusion and exclusion that underlie the cultural mythology of “America.” Topics to be considered include: colonial and creole identities; the relationship between writing and empire; encounters between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in the “New World”; the nature of the “American Renaissance”; the meaning of American individualism; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; and the American obsession with race. Authors: Columbus, Cabeza de Vaca, Bradford, Winthrop, Rowlandson, Bradstreet, Edwards, Franklin, Jefferson, Brown, Foster, Douglass, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Stowe, Hawthorne, and Melville.

           This advanced nonfiction writing course explores the creative possibilities of both the persuasive and familiar essay forms. With the Art of Memory as the organizing principle, our material will include works by Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, Joseph Conrad, John Fowles, John Berger, Margaret Atwood and Andre Aciman as well as films directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Pedro Almodovar. The course combines discussion seminars and writing workshops with one-on-one conferences with the professor. Students work on honing their own narrative voices and aim to produce honors level work by the end of the semester.

           Why do some texts—and not others—travel well enough to be read and taught with interest outside of their cultures of origin? Why this beautiful piece of writing, and not that one? Who are the arbiters of international taste? What is lost and gained in translation?

           Our class is a writing workshop that emphasizes shoptalk: how to begin a story; how to introduce a character; how to avoid the bumpy ending. We read student submissions and also works of published fiction, both good and bad. (Stories that make mistakes are a great learning tool.) We take up such impossible questions as, What is the relationship of plot to sub-plot? How does one hold the reader’s attention? In art rules must be flexible, but students are asked to think of writing in strategic terms; each story-telling decision needs to make tactical sense. With that in mind, we examine—with so much esprit de corps as to arouse envy—the tenets of the craft of fiction.

           This course presents narrative literature as a set of springboards to performance, rather than as a series of books simply to be read privately. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach literature as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory, as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and on their language abilities. For their final project, students collaborate in staging and performing a substantial piece of traditional narrative. Works discussed and performed include epics, romances, ballads, and short tales of various kinds, drawn from world literature. In J-term 2015, students will perform from the medieval French Arthurian romance
           <em>
            Yvain or the Knight with the Lion
           </em>
           by Chretien de Troyes and from the Spanish epic
           <em>
            The Song of the Cid
           </em>
           . Short works (in a Course Packet) will be taken from the following—and will thus represent a wide range of kinds of narrative and modes of performance: ballads from Spain and India; tales from Latin (
           <em>
            The Scholar’s Guide
           </em>
           ), medieval French (various types of tales), Turkish (
           <em>
            The Book of Dede Korkut
           </em>
           ), Hebrew (
           <em>
            Tahkemoni
           </em>
           ), Arabic (
           <em>
            Kalila and Dimna
           </em>
           ,
           <em>
            1001 Nights
           </em>
           ), and Urdu (
           <em>
            Amir Hamza
           </em>
           ). Students will be invited to perform in the original languages wherever possible, and an attempt will be made to include works from the students’ own traditions.

           Long before modern media sent stories around the world at lightning speed, good tales traveled. This course explores the travel of tales and considers the ways in which a common culture of story and storytelling can be found throughout pre-modern Europe, Middle East, South and East Asia. Drawing on stories and scholarship from many different traditions, it examines the role of storytelling in human culture, discusses the performance and circulation of stories, and reflects on examples of the types of tales that traveled--including tales of origin, of wisdom (and folly), of trickery (and truthfulness), of success (and failure), of youth and age, of love and the battle of the sexes—and many others.

           The Arab presence in the Americas is a mix of history and legend, fact and fantasy. Twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi reports that eight Arabs sailed west from Lisbon to discover what lay beyond the “Sea of Darkness” (the Atlantic ocean), and arrived somewhere in South America. Columbus reportedly had a copy of al-Idrisi’s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of U.S. American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. We will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.

           This course will examine three “encyclopedic” texts (War and Peace, Ulysses, One Hundred Years of Solitude) that rehearse and interrogate inherited paradigms of cultural identity, purpose, and destiny. Through sustained attention to formal and ideological tenets of these specific texts, we will also seek to interrogate some of the salient procedures of realism, modernism, and postcolonialism.

           This course focuses on writing poetry by experimenting with a variety of poetic forms and writing prompts, including 20th-century and contemporary poetry and statements and essays written by poets. Students will write poetry as well as learn terms for critical analysis. Some of the threads of inquiry and inspiration that will run through the workshop include: What is poetry? What does it do? What is the state of poetry now? What does it mean to write and read poems in English if it is not your home or only language? In addition to workshopping peers’ poetry, participants will learn about the chapbook tradition, make their own small books of between 15 and 25 pages, and organize readings to experiment with various performance-based approaches to poetry.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. In the tutorial, students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty director to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a senior thesis. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the senior thesis. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project that may include students majoring in other disciplines such as the arts, and the natural and social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant.

           A fundamental understanding of mathematical functions is critical before engaging in the rigors of calculus. This course examines single variable functions, including their algebraic and geometric properties. The course begins with a rigorous exploration of the following question: What is a function, and how can it be represented geometrically as a graph? The course delves into standard function manipulations and examines a range of mathematical functions, including polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Placement into Mathematical Functions is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

           A Vector is a mathematical measure of change in magnitude and direction of a physical event.  For example, a displacement from one location to another
           <br/>
           in a  two or three dimensional space, or the quantity and direction of force applied to move an object are examples of vectors. This course studies the algebra of vector addition, subtraction and the Dot Product Multiplication and Cross Product Multiplication. The course further provides an in depth study of trigonometric functions, trigonometric equations and trigonometric identities including  Double Angle and Half Angle Formulas and their application. The concept of Average Rate of Change Limit and Derivatives for both Scalars and Vectors Two and Three Dimensional Coordinates in Cartesian, Spherical and Polar Form are discussed and the merits of each are presented.Systems of Linear Equations are presented using matrices and their properties including the inverse of a matrix to help solve linear systems. Finite and Infinite Sequences are discussed A comparison of Real and Complex Numbers is reviewed and several applications of the Algebra of Complex Numbers is presented to solidify how to use them  in applications.

           This course presents the foundations of calculus by examining functions and their derivatives and integrals, with an emphasis on proofs and theorems and an introduction to basic mathematical analysis. While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly discussion section that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major or for students who seek an in-depth understanding of the arguments that support calculus. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.

           This course presents the foundations of calculus by examining functions and their derivatives and integrals with a special emphasis placed on the utilitarian nature of the subject material. Applications to natural science, engineering, and the social sciences, particularly economics, are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly discussion section focused on applications of calculus in science, engineering, or social science, depending on their primary interest. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.
          </p>

           In many applications of mathematics a response of some systems is nearly a linear function of the input. These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations. The material in this course includes systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination, matrices, determinants, Cramer’s rule, vectors, vector spaces, basis and dimension, linear transformations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and quadratic forms.

           Ordinary differential equations arise in virtually all fields of applied mathematics. Newton’s equations of motion, the rate equations of chemical reactions, the currents flowing in electric circuits, all can be expressed as ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations usually evolve a combination of analytic and numerical methods. The course studies first- and second-order equations, solutions using infinite series, Laplace transforms, linear systems, numerical methods.

           This course comprises a combination of the theory of probability and the mathematical foundations with techniques of modern statistical analysis. It is designed to acquaint the student with both probability and statistics in the context of their applications to the sciences. In probability: mathematical treatment of chance; combinatorics; binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions; law of large numbers and the normal distribution; application to coin-tossing, radioactive decay, and so on. In statistics: sampling; normal and other useful distributions; testing of hypotheses; confidence intervals; correlation and regression; and applications to scientific, industrial, and financial data.

           Algebra is a part of every field of mathematics, and has applications in the discrete systems of computer science. Fractions, together with their familiar laws of addition, multiplication, and division, provide an example of algebra. The complex numbers form another. This course introduces more general algebras, and their properties and applications. Topics considered in this course include groups, homomorphisms, automorphisms and permutation groups. Rings, ideals and quotient rings, Euclidean rings, and polynomial rings are also considered.

           One of the most remarkable applications of abstract algebra is the solution of algebraic equations: for example, to finding the roots of a polynomial. This course develops the ideas needed to study this problem, culminating in the celebrated theory of Galois. The topics include extension fields and roots of polynomials, constructions with straight edge and compass. Unique factorization in rings, elements of Galois theory.

           Many of the complex systems of natural science can be formulated as a dynamical system—one whose changes are determined only by the current state. These systems are typically nonlinear, and often exhibit the random behavior associated with chaos. Topics of the course include: dynamics of maps and of first-order and second-order differential equations; stability, bifurcations, limit cycles, dissection of systems with fast and slow time scales. The geometric viewpoint, including phase planes, are stressed. Chaotic behavior is introduced in the context of one-variable maps (the logistic), fractal sets, etc. Applications are drawn from physics and biology.

           Complex analysis is a powerful tool with diverse applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. Functions of a complex variable arise in elasticity, electrical engineering, and in fluid dynamics, to name a few examples. The geometrical content of analysis in the complex plane is especially appealing. Topics include: complex numbers and complex functions; differentiation and the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy’s theorem, and the Cauchy integral formula; singularities, residues, Taylor and Laurent series; fractional linear transformations and conformal mapping; analytic continuation; and applications to fluid flow.

           Often the most difficult part of the task of the applied mathematician is the formulation of an analyzable model in the face of a perplexing phenomenon or data set. This course is designed to give students an introduction to all aspects of this process. The course consists of several modules, each a self-contained problem, taken from biology, economics, and other areas of science. In the process the student experiences the formulation and analysis of a model and its validation by numerical simulation and comparison with data. The mathematical tools to be developed include dimensional analysis, optimization, simulation, probability, and elementary differential equations. The necessary mathematical and scientific background is developed as needed. Students participate in formulating models as well as in analyzing them.

           Perhaps the purest of pure mathematics, number theory nevertheless finds important application to cryptography and computer science generally. The recent solution of Fermat’s last theorem brought attention to the subject. In mathematics, number theory is associated with many outstanding problems, including the famous Riemann hypothesis. Topics to be covered include divisibility theory and prime numbers, linear and quadratic congruences, the classical number-theoretic functions, continued fractions, and diophantine equations.

           Many laws of physics are formulated as partial differential equations, e.g., the propagation of sound waves, the diffusion of a gas, and the flow of a fluid. This course discusses the simplest examples of such laws as embodied in the wave equation, the diffusion equation, and Laplace’s equation. The course also discusses nonlinear conservation laws and the theory of shock waves. Applications to physics, chemistry, biology, and population dynamics are given.

           Analysis builds a more rigorous foundation for calculus and prepares the way for more advanced courses. The emphasis is on the careful formulation of the concepts of calculus, and the formulation and proof of key theorems. The goal is to understand the need for and the nature of a mathematical proof. The course studies the real number system, the convergence of sequences and series, functions of one real variable, continuity, connectedness, compactness, and metric spaces.

           Topology is a major branch of mathematics, which is concerned with the geometry of sets of points in space of arbitrary dimension. One aspect of the subject deals with the classification of sets based upon their structure, not their specific shape. Topology has applications in physics, biology, and dynamical systems. The material includes metric spaces, topological spaces, compactness, connectedness, covering spaces,

           The capstone seminar provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD mathematicians and others in related fields. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth mathematics capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.  Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

           This course introduces students to the fundamental dynamics of Earth’s atmosphere and its oceans. These two systems are then integrated into a global picture of the biosphere. Topics include: the carbon cycle, climate feedbacks and anthropogenic influences; global ecology, energy transport, the paleoclimate record, the coupled atmosphereocean-ice-land system, and climate modeling. The course addresses local and global issues such as desertification, carbon production by fossil fuels, and green technology as exemplified in Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City, which is attempting to become the world’s first carbonneutral, zero-waste city.

           Economic analysis of major policy issues in energy and the environment, both domestic and international, is key for understanding the global impact of energy use. This course emphasizes market solutions to various problems and market limitations in the allocation of environmental resources. Energy issues focus on OPEC and world oil markets; taxation and regulation of production and consumption; conservation of natural resources; and the transition to alternative energy sources. Environmental issues include policies to reduce pollution. Substantial attention is paid to global warming caused by consumption of fossil fuels.

           In March 2012, the OECD published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources.  In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes.  We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching  the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.

           This class strives to create media literacy by asking students to study the history, theory, and practice of creating, distributing, and consuming media. What is media’s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

           Mobile devices (phones and tablets) are used for both the production and consumption of rich media, augmenting their original purpose as one-to-one communication devices. This course explores the technology that enables the consumption and production of new forms of media on these devices with an eye toward how that media can be used in conjunction with the devices’ original social and communicative purposes. Students create projects that utilize the available technology to explore new forms of media creation and consumption.

           Computing, information technology, and digital media are integrated into all aspects of contemporary life including commerce, finance, education, politics, entertainment, communication, and social life. This course studies these technologies through the lens of social, political, and ethical values investigating whether and how technical systems promote or impede values to which we are committed. While we explore concepts and literatures, students form collaborative groups, select projects and apply philosophical and social theories of technology to analyze and, possibly, design, prototype, and build systems. The course welcomes students with a variety of backgrounds and skills, though some prior understanding of and experience with digital technology and media, and computing or social, political, and ethical analysis is recommended.

           This course approaches questions such as "What is performance?", "What  makes a musical interface intuitive and emotionally immediate?", and "How do we create meaningful correlations between performance gestures and their musical consequences?" Over the semester, we look at many examples of current work by creators of musical interfaces, and discuss a wide range of issues facing technology-enabled performance. Students will design and prototype a musical instrument - a complete system encompassing musical controller, algorithm for mapping input to sound, and the sound output itself. A technical framework for  prototyping performance controllers is made available. Students focus on musical composition and improvisation techniques as they prepare their prototypes for live performance.

           As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are becoming accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Subscribing to a process-oriented approach, much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development.

           The advent of video heralded a new, mediated form of expression, quickly embraced by artists, journalists, and provocateurs. This course provides an overview of video art since its inception in the late 1960s and is designed to trace the path of the medium to contemporary practices. Emerging methods of video interaction in the context of performance and installation will be applied. Students will develop their own work while examining technical and aesthetic concepts embedded in existing pieces.

           Abu Dhabi, with its urban plan for the future, Plan Abu Dhabi 2030, has globally positioned itself as a progressive laboratory of urbanism. The course provides an immersion in the planning issues that Abu Dhabi confronts and that are central to the future of the 21st-century city. We read key texts in urban theory and design, and consider their applicability to the city’s specific context and morphology. The course includes field trips to key projects and feature guest speakers who are defining the future of the city. By the end of the course, students have in-depth knowledge of Abu Dhabi, its urban form, future goals, and challenges; think critically about successful city building with a comparative approach to experiences elsewhere.

Since 2007, Plan Capital 2030 laid the foundation for a progressive and comprehensive approach with sustainability as an overarching principle. The course will introduce a full understanding of the evolution of the city, examine plans for Abu Dhabi, and learn about the main urban actors and the forces shaping its growth. Through reading key texts in urban theories, site visits, guest speakers, presentations and debates, students will be able to think critically about city planning and development in rapidly developing cities and key challenges in comparison to other regional and global examples.

           Modernism was a broad movement in literature, arts, music, and architecture that flourished first in Europe and then the United States between from the turn into the twentieth century until just after the Second World War. This course examines the ways in which New Yorkers reshaped European modernism and created a distinctive legacy that marks the city to this day. Exploring the reciprocal relationship between modernism and the city, the course investigates how modernism was shaped by urban experience and how, in turn, modernism helped to mold our conception of the modern city.

           This course provides an overview of key issues in the culture and politics of urban life, with a focus on modern Buenos Aires. We engage class and contemporary urban questions such as: How does city-living shape our minds and shift our patterns of social interaction? How does the built environment relate to the local ecology and our experience of everyday life? How are civic and political institutions addressing emerging problems related to massive population growth, sprawl, pollution, and polarization? Students should be prepared for rigorous critical thinking and vigorous participation.

           The world’s urban population is anticipated to reach 5 billion by 2030. The rise of mega-cities has captured much attention, however most of the world’s urban growth will take place in small to mid-size cities. To some extent, this is a desirable trend as smaller urban environments and utopian models of urban development. This course is a comparative study of the evolution of 19th and 20th century urban infrastructure. It examines the designs of complex infrastructure networks for moving people, goods, water, waste, energy, and information: from pipelines to the telecommunication network, from sidewalks to freeways and ports, and from personal carriers to mass transit.  In this course students develop a perspective on how the growth of urban population in first half of 19th century led to innovations in the second half of the century that sustained the tremendous growth of 19th century urban population; and how this trend continued to support that growth in the 20th century urban population. Each student will select a city and research the evolution of the various layers of that city’s infrastructure. The student “Cities Project” will be presented in the form of maps, photos, videos, interviews, stories.

           This course introduces students to the life of cities, their creation and development over time, and the effect of cities on the lives of people. Drawing on diverse disciplines, such as sociology, history, geography, and political science, it explores the process of urbanization, focusing on major theories of urbanization, the urban way of life, and problems related to the urbanization process. It also places these urban processes within a transnational and global context.

           Consumption of objects, images, and places is central to the culture and economy of modern life. The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx’s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber’s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel’s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin’s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States. Site visits in Buenos Aires help deepen our analysis of cities and consumption, and illuminate our surroundings.

           This course is an introduction to the role of urban design in global sustainability. The first step is to understand how cities affect climate and how climate affects cities by examining New York as a model. New York is a coastal city faced with the simultaneous requirement to grow its population by a million people yet to improve the quality of its civic life when climate events threaten both its urban fabric and critical infrastructure. How New York uses urban design not just to survive but to thrive is the subject of this course, introducing the people, products, and processes of urban design. The city itself frequently serves as classroom, with students exploring and recording examples of urban design through the neighborhoods they transform.

           Shanghai has evolved markedly through key stages in the history of urban form, vestiges of which are found within the city today: an old walled "Chinese city"; tree-lined boulevards and commercial avenues of 19th and 20th century foreign settlements; and suburban development in Pudong. This class examines each key stage, combining readings with in situ urban inquiry. Readings cover Chinese reflections on the city in general and Shanghai in particular, as well as urban studies classics like Lewis Mumford’s The Culture of Cities Trips take students to historically significant cultural spaces, including the old City God Temple, Fuzhou Road Bookshops, alleyway houses, The Peace Hotel, the Great World amusement park, People’s Park, the Moganshan Road contemporary art complex, as well as nearby waterway towns that illustrate aspects of Shanghai’s history before urbanization.

           Cities are our most powerful engines of growth and increasingly the economic organizing units of our time. More than half the world’s population lives in cities and urban areas, a figure that grow to 70 percent by 2050. We will look in detail at great global cities across the world, giving students the concepts and tools to understand their evolution and the critical roles they play in economic, social, cultural and human development. The course also helps students better understand how their choice of a city to live in can have an indelible impact on their lives and careers.

           What is globalization and when did it begin? What is the difference between an imperial city and a global capital? Imperial London provides a way to explore this question, and New York, which was not capital of a vast colonial empire, provides a useful comparison case. There is also the question of globalization’s impact on the relation between cities and nations? More directly, have global cities outgrown their host nations? Is globalization a new iteration of the world economy, or is it more multi-faceted, with social, political, and cultural implications, including new dimensions of citizenship and social movements? Can one "read" shift from the age of empire to that of globalization in the built environment of the city of London, New York, Jakarta, or Ho Chi Minh City? Assignments includes literary sources and visual analysis as well as social science and humanistic scholarship.

           Public spaces play an essential role in the life of cities and their residents. Public squares and parks, streets and esplanades—these are often the signature spaces that constitute a city’s distinctive identity. They are also the settings of everyday life, mixing bowls where a city’s diverse communities interact, forums for individual as well as collective action and expression. This course explores the nature of public space in cities around the world, with attention to their physical character and design, their history, their pictorial and literary representation, and the political and social practices that activate public space. We will explore three overarching questions. What do we mean by “public” and “public space”? What are common characteristics of public spaces and how do people use them? And why are public spaces important to city life? In addition to historical and contemporary squares and streetscapes of Europe and the Middle East, we will draw upon case studies in Sydney as well as the hometowns of our students.

           This course provides students with essential musical skills and conceptual frameworks that will ready them for future coursework in music theory.  These fundamentals are explored in relation not only to canonic Western "classical" music, but also to popular music and musics from around the globe. Topics include Western music notation (reading music), tuning systems, the science of sound, instruments, scales, modes, keys, intervals, chords, jazz/pop/rock chord symbols, figured bass, harmonic analysis using Roman numerals, species counterpoint, basic four-part chorale writing, and common forms and genres.  A weekly lab session serves to develop listening skills, basic keyboard skills, sight-singing, and dictation.
          </p>
          <p>
           <br/>
           Note: Music Theory Fundamentals is a prerequisite for the required music major gateway course, Music Theory &amp; Analysis I.  Students can take a placement test to pass out of Music Theory Fundamentals and enroll directly in Music Theory &amp; Analysis I. Please contact the instructor or Head of Music Program for details.

           This course introduces students to several modes of inquiry as it explores and introduces a wide repertoire of musical materials. We explore approaches to music, stressing historical, documentary, and archival work and contrast these with ethnographic, philosophical, and empirical/scientific modes of investigation. Repertoire varies from year to year, but includes such aspects as Beethoven symphonies, North Indian instrumental music, Middle Eastern song, and new technologies such as auto-tune and new arenas for music such as video games and ring tones.

           Required for all music majors.  This course views musical structures and constructs broadly, referencing phenomena from musics around the world. The bulk of the course is devoted to an exploration of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in the music of diatonic tonality through projects in directed composition and analysis. Repertoire is drawn from both “classical” (common practice period) music and more recent examples of tonality, including popular music. Regular reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context and expose students to a wide range of musical examples. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills.

           The Near East (including North Africa, Turkey, Iran and the Gulf) has experienced enormous upheavals over the past century, in large part because of borders drawn by political rather than cultural considerations. Today's Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

           Rather than present stylistic overviews, this course focuses on selected works and introduces them in various contexts. Depending on the experience and expertise of the instructor, the course might focus on Bach fugues, Mozart opera, Schoenberg’s piano music, or the development of electro-acoustic music. While the focus is on issues of how these works create effects, and resultant questions of meaning, we also look at sociological and political issues.

           This practical course endeavors to expose students to the various processes and tools by which music is creatively conceived and brought to public life. Students of various skill sets gain the necessary footing to develop/envision themselves as music practitioners/makers in a changing global landscape, as we endeavor to focus on cosmopolitan music practices that draw on the uniqueness of the U.A.E. as a global site. Students work in teams to develop creative music projects involving original writing/composition, recording, and performance. They also develop a basic creative plan for dissemination that also involves emergent and/or interactive media. The course additionally has a historical scope in which students consider how aforementioned broad
           <br/>
           course questions have been addressed at different key moments in history and how the complexion of those questions has differed in various national and regional contexts.

           Private instruction in Composition is designed for students wanting to create musical work under supervision. This work can be for instruments, voice, electronics, or a combination of the three, for a variety of purposes, ranging from traditional concert music to music for film or for interactive computer applications such as games. Students learn compositional techniques and strategies that are tailored to help them achieve their compositional goals. The created work is presented in concert or at a similar public artistic manifestation.

           Further exploration of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in tonal music through projects in directed composition and analysis, transitioning into 20th-century and contemporary musical developments. Topics include small- and large-scale musical forms, modulation, mixture, chromaticism, and an array of modernist and post-modernist compositional practices.  A weekly lab session develops skills in musicianship and reinforces theoretical concepts.

           Techniques of analyzing Western “classical” tonal music are well codified, but investigating the workings of non-Western traditions demands creativity, research, and careful consideration of the practical and cultural perspectives. This course surveys a variety of musics, with a particular emphasis on careful listening and aural analysis. Assigned readings help to contextualize and problematize the listening, shedding light on musical preconceptions and biases. Each student chooses from a diverse array of research topics early in the semester, preparing for a substantial presentation during the final weeks of class.

           This introductory course uses the voice as a way of approaching basic questions of musical style, technique, theory, and meaning. Using singing as the primary instrument, students explore different tuning systems, from the equal temperament of the Western classical tradition, to other systems with different patterns, inflections, and approaches to intonation. This course includes discussions of aesthetics and raises issues of musical meaning in different cultural contexts, and looks specifically at the musical traditions of the region. Students are encouraged to work creatively in the different traditions we encounter.

           This studio course focuses on the use of sound as a sculptural artistic medium with special emphasis on audio installation, broadcasting, and editing. The course challenges students to expand their notion of studio practice to consider non-visual concepts, improvisation, participatory work, and performative intervention. Students build upon their current artistic strategies in order to bring dynamics of location, duration, and interaction to their work. We work with techniques such as basic recording and editing, real-time mixing and composition, digital editing, critical listening, web broadcasting, FM radio transmission. In addition, we listen to a range of audio material from artists, musicians, and others, watch films that address audio concepts, and read selections from a survey of texts about contemporary music and audio culture.

           Departing from the Wagnerian notion of Gesamkunstwerk, this course examines paradigmatic artistic collaborations in the 20th century and the impact of digital technologies in promoting more intricate types of collaboration between different domains, such as music, performing arts, moving image, engineering and computer science. Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.

           In the past decades, hip-hop has transformed from a local, economically viable method of musical production in the post-industrial city to the transnational core of the popular music industry. This course will introduce students from any discipline to critical scholarly approaches to hip-hop and its multiple roles worldwide in youth advocacy, community organizing, and political protest. We will examine its roots in New York, West Africa and the Caribbean, and its enormous appeal among urban youth today. This course emphasizes readings that engage critically with migration, class, gender performativity and sociolinguistics, supported by case studies from Europe, Africa and the Middle East. For course essays, students will prepare CD reviews or concert reports for publication in academic journals or the popular press.

           World Music originally meant that celebrity musicians from the West, like Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel and David Byrne, traveled to developing countries to work with local artists, or they would incorporate founds sounds from developing countries into their musical output. In the 21st century, however, a more complex model of transcultural music-making has emerged, one made increasingly possible by the ubiquity of digital and mobile recording technologies. That cosmopolitan model—deployed by artists ranging from Damon Albarn, Angelique Kidjo, MTMK, Gustavo Santoalalla to A.R. Rahman— involves cross-cultural and transnational collaboration between musicians of different stylistic traditions, often toward the goal of creating syncretic musical and sonic results. This course aims to teach students certain best practices for creating cross-cultural, transnational popular music. Students travel and work collaboratively with guest artists and local musicians to compose, arrange, record and produce. Emphasis is placed on DIY and portable recording in makeshift or transitional locations.

           The influence of South Asian contemporary music (i.e. Bhangra and Bollywood) has become a global phenomena as demonstrated by Jay-Z rapping on Panjabi MC’s international smash hit “Beware,” the pervasiveness of hip-hop’s use of classical India instrumentation, and the increased presence of Bollywood soundtracks at the Oscars as well as in mainstream American film. The music genres of Bhangra and Bollywood, however, are often conflated and misused terms to describe the Indian influence in contemporary music. In this course, we survey the various genres of South Asian music and how they intersect with contemporary American culture. This exploration includes a look at the global forces (corporate, cultural, political) that shape both the sound and presence of these musical forms in modern dance, music and popular culture. We also consider ideas of authenticity, appropriation, co-optation as they relate to increased presence of these genres of music in American media.

           The class examines the musical traditions that have been preserved and invented as a result of the Black diaspora. Students can expect to learn about: Rasta, Ethiopia, and the role of H.I.M. Haile Selassie in the 1930s and beyond; mento, the salacious, swinging folk that predated ska; how and why ska evolved into rocksteady in the 1960s; the function of jazz within reggae; the pivotal figure of Robert Nesta Marley, and O.M and the Wailers band.

           The concept of improvisation is essential to music-making the world over, but is often poorly understood, and with the exception of jazz, rarely treated with much respect. This course explores the idea of improvisation as understood in varied musical cultures across the world, and explores both its connection to and distance from the concept of composition. Students learn to improvise in a selected group of styles that might include developing a cadenza to a Mozart piano concerto, creating a song in the style of Monk, learning a North Indian rag, or studying Balinese Gamelan music.

           This seminar is a survey that provides a forum for exploring music and musical practices across a wide range of historical and cultural situations from ancient times to the present. Beginning with music in the myths and ancient history of Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece, the seminar concludes with an examination music and musical production within emerging global and transnational networks of power where new technologies of mediation are radically re-orchestrating our experience of the world. Within broad scope of this overview, we will examine the historical repertoire that has come to be known as "classical music." The course explores the idea of a permanent canon of musical masterworks, which as a nineteenth-century invention, expanded gradually to include much earlier music as it became increasingly known. The course is not limited to the European musical tradition and canon but also examines non-Western musical traditions in the Middle East, Asia, and India, which grew out of complex confluence of established practices.

           Abu Dhabi is a cosmopolitan musical culture with an increasingly vibrant musical life. From local weddings to symphony orchestra concerts, and from Moroccan nightclubs to religious singing, this course looks at the broad musical cultures of Abu Dhabi, including everything from traditional Emirati wedding music to visiting ensembles from Poland or Iraq. Each student undertakes a specific project related to some aspect of music in the area, and the class will make frequent visits to performance venues. We anticipate several trips to other cities in the Emirates for comparative purposes.

           The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording.  The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).

           This course provides a forum for exploring the development of opera across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts. Focusing on the shifting nature of power, politics, and patronage that have shaped the history of the genre from the time of its birth in the late sixteenth-century Italian courts, the seminar concludes with an examination of newly commissioned works that reflect radical changes in the artistic production and of the genre. Beginning with Monteverdi’s Orfeo from 1607, the course explores the development of opera in nineteenth century Europe and Russia where the interaction of cultural, political, and social factors made it the most important genre of that period. Whether examining Wagner’s radical transformation of opera in works like Tristan and Isolde and Parsifal or narratives of contemporary history in John Adams’ Nixon in China, we explore opera as a genre shaped by the power, politics, and patronage of its given age.

           The explosion of rock ‘n’ roll into the popular music scene of the 1950’s took the world by surprise. Although it seemed as if the music had come out of nowhere, it had a long evolution with roots in Afro-American music traditions.  This survey examines the roots and evolution of rock ‘n’ roll, focusing in particular on the critical role it played in the anti-war and peace movements of the 1960s as well as in movements for civil rights and social justice from that time to the present. Interdisciplinary in its conception, the seminar draws on materials from diverse disciplines in order to provide a critical frame for the exploration of the topic.

           This course explores the complex relationship between music and the environment as it is articulated in the emerging field of “ecomusicology,” which considers music and sonic issues, whether textual or performative, as related to ecology and the natural environment. Although the field developed parallel to growing concerns about the environment since 1970, the course begins its trajectory with nineteenth century conceptions of nature in the writings of Emerson and Thoreau, exploring parallel musical conceptions of nature and landscape in the works of nineteenth-century American composers such as MacDowell and Charles Ives.  Focusing attention on the use of nature and landscape as powerful and contested functions of the formation of national identity in the nineteenth century, the course explores later conceptions of “nature” in the music and sonic landscapes and urban design of the twentieth and twenty first centuries in light of the current environmental crisis.

           This course will explore the meaning of sound in the urban and natural environments within Abu Dhabi and the UAE. An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques.  The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines in the humanities, the natural and the social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant..

           Introduction to the social, cultural, and political history of museums. This course focuses on the formation of the modern museum. Museums of art, natural history, science, technology, and anthropology are examined from a variety of disciplinary approaches that explore the institution and its practices with respect to governance, colonialism, nationalism, class, gender, ethnicity, and community. Visits to the museums and cultural institutions in the region are an important part of this course.

           This course focuses on defining the main functions of museums and examining how they relate in practice to their stated mission. The purposes, processes, and ethics of such fundamental tasks as acquisitions, conservation, installations, exhibitions, and interpretation are examined in detail with particular attention to how the work of art is perceived in its many different guises and contexts. The role of museums in our age of globalization are also be discussed. Some classes may be taught on site and individual museum visits by students may be required.

           An intensive trade and shipping network connected many countries around the Indian Ocean with the Far East and Europe. Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces—in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered "shared cultural heritage." Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

           While New York City is known for its world class museums and endless array of commercial galleries, the mainstream art world in Manhattan is only half the story. This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city’s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York’s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?

           This course explores the relationship between the modern museum and sixteenth-century "cabinets of wonder," which presented the viewer with compartments and drawers containing amazing items from different eras and parts of the world. Students investigate the antecedents of these cabinets in mnemonic practices in ancient classical culture, shifting notions of wonder and curiosity in the Middle Ages, and the new models of learning and state governance in the Early Modern period that assigned these cabinets a "laboratory" function. Students explore how, in the period leading to our modern times, new models of classification, taxonomy, and scientific discovery led to a continued process of recollection and re-collecting objects from the past.

           This course looks at government policies and private sector practices that have helped to shape how the arts and culture are understood and valued around the world. Students examine and compare major issues and concepts impacting the production, distribution, and consumption of the arts and culture within and across borders, such as national sovereignty, heritage and cultural patrimony, historic preservation, cultural diplomacy, arts funding systems, and the role of the arts in the design, development, and revitalization of world cities from Bilbao, Spain to Los Angeles to the Arabian Gulf. The course also explores the for-profit sector looking at such issues as artists’ rights, art markets, the creative industries, international trade law, and copyright in the digital age. Cultural site visits and field trips are a regular part of the course.

           This course explores the idea of ‘sharing heritage’ through a series of case studies in which material goods considered to belong to a nation’s national patrimony have become the object of public discussion, international controversy, and legal action. Students investigate the ways in which local politics, preservation policies, myths of national identity, international law and heritage conventions, historical sensibilities, and the media influence the circulation of art works, “collectibles,” and other objects intended for public display. Students discuss the different strategies that museums and exhibition-makers have developed to deal with disputes over “heritage” across national boundaries and cultural differences.

           In the 17th century the Ya’rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered "shared cultural heritage". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if "universal values" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

           This course surveys the history and representational role of museums, from its origins in cabinets of curiosity formed during the age of exploration to the global proliferation of museums today. Our goal is to provide a critical framework to understand how and why museums have evolved and function in a globalized world. We will consider how Enlightment collecting practices led to the development of the “universal museum” in an era of colonial expansion and examine how this dominant model has expanded – and been challenged – over the past century. Among the issues to be discussed are: the organization and display of collections, the language and symbolism of museum architecture, the relationship of museums to their public(s), heritage and repatriation, cultural diversity and the politics of representation, and globalized collecting and exhibiting today. Classroom lectures will be supplemented by field trips drawing on the rich diversity of museums in the New York area.

           This class will introduce students to the foundational theoretical approaches to peace from a psychological perspective. The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,
           <br/>
           violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

           How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

           The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the
           <br/>
           UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today’s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they
           <br/>
           provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations’ origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today’s international system.

           This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing “best practices” approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world’s most challenging regions.

           This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine – indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species.  To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence.  We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence.  We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of “political religions” – Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority.  Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

           An introduction to philosophy through the study of issues at the intersection of philosophy and cognitive science. We will focus on the conflict between computational and biological approaches to understanding the mind. Topics will include whether a machine could think, the Turing Test, mental imagery, the possibility of artificial intelligence, the reduction of the mind to the brain, and the function of consciousness.

           We are all going to die. This course examines a number of puzzles that arise once we start to think about our mortality. Is death bad for us? How could it be, when we will no longer be around to be the subject of the harm? Is death any worse for us than our nonexistence was prior to our birth? Is it bad not to be born at all? If so, for whom is it bad? Are we, in some sense, immortal? Is immortality even desirable? What is the appropriate attitude toward death? Can suicide be moral or rational? Is there any sense in which we could survive our deaths? How should the knowledge that we are going to die affect the way we should live our lives?

           Do we have free will? Can we think of ourselves as responsible agents while also regarding ourselves as part of the natural order? Some philosophers have argued that if our actions are causally determined, then freedom of the will is impossible. Others have argued that freedom does not depend on the truth or falsity of causal determinism. Is free will possible in a world where every event is causally determined? Are there different kinds of freedom? If so, are all kinds of freedom equally worth having? Must we act freely in order to be responsible for our actions? Do the social institutions of reward and punishment depend for their justification upon the existence of responsible, free agents? We will discuss the nature of persons, action, freedom, and responsibility in an effort to answer these questions.

           An examination of various questions that arise in philosophical discussions of religion, such as: Can philosophical reflection help us to prove the existence of God or clarify such puzzling matters as God's relationship to time? How could a benevolent and omnipotent God permit the existence of evil and misfortune? Is it ever rational to form beliefs about matters which transcend the realm of the empirical? Is the concept of a specifically religious experience a coherent one? If not, can religious beliefs be supported by other means? Alternatively, is the entire project of evaluating religious discourse as a set of claims about transcendent realities misguided? What should we make of the alternative explanations of religion and religious phenomena offered by philosophers from al-Farabi to Marx and Nietzsche?

           It is often thought that knowledge is inherently valuable and that "truth" is an objective notion independent of social considerations. This course examines various reasons we might have for holding these views, and various challenges that have been raised against them. Why should we care about knowledge as long as our beliefs prove useful and efficacious? Is truth -- and thus knowledge - more accurately understood as a culturally relative notion, so that what’s true for you might not be true for me? It is ever rational to let purely pragmatic reasons for belief trump considerations of truth? And could we ever will (or force) ourselves to believe something? These are some of the questions we’ll explore in this course.

           All philosophers are wise, and Socrates is a philosopher. Therefore, Socrates is wise. Our topic is the nature of this “therefore.” Logic is the science of reasoning—the study of the ways in which statements support or contradict one another. In this course, we investigate and expose the logical structure of everyday language and see how the correctness or incorrectness of reasoning depends on this structure. To aid us, we develop a formal language that makes this underlying structure more perspicuous. With this formal language at our disposal, we are able to construct elaborate proofs and explore the logical relations among the various steps of complex arguments.

           An examination of the origins of Western philosophical thought in ancient Greece and Rome, with a special focus on the views of Plato and Aristotle. Through their work, we will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers we will be studying thought that philosophy must be systematic in its approach, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.

           An introduction to the original continuation of Western philosophy in its post-ancient phase: Arabic philosophy in the form of falsafa, as developed and debated by Muslims, Christians, and Jews from the eighth to the twelfth century. The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.

           An exploration of the thought of major philosophers from the Indian subcontinent, beginning with the ancients in the fifth century BCE and concluding with thinkers on the eve of colonialism in the eighteenth century CE. Indian philosophy has been and continues to be a major world philosophy. The reach of its ideas has been vast, both historically and geographically, spanning the philosophies of Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, and Hinduism, as well as the philosophy of law, of medicine, of mathematics, and of politics and society. It is most strongly associated with wide-ranging discussions in the philosophy of mind, the study of language, epistemology, and metaphysics. The aim of the course is to present a balanced and impartial picture of the richness, diversity, and depth of philosophy in this region.

           A survey of European philosophy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—one of the most exciting and formative periods in the history of Western philosophy. We focus on six philosophers: René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Through their writings, we trace and study philosophical arguments and debates concerning the possibility and extent of our knowledge of the external world, the nature of the self, the nature of substance and causation, the existence of God, the nature of perception, and the relation between our minds and our bodies.

           A survey of philosophy on the European continent in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beginning with German Idealism and proceeding through Marxism, existentialism, phenomenology, critical theory, and structuralism. This course will introduce you to many of the major thinkers of this period, including Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Arendt, Sartre, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Foucault. These philosophers stand in the background of a great deal of contemporary political, social, and literary theory: their reactions to and criticisms of the Enlightenment’s celebration of reason continue to challenge us.

           Epistemology is the study of knowledge and rational belief. In this course we examine various central epistemological questions, including: What is knowledge, and how does it differ from belief? Can we have knowledge of anything outside our own minds, such as physical objects or other minds? Or is the skeptic’s attack on our commonplace claims to know unanswerable? What is the relation between knowledge and perception? Is it ever rational to believe in the absence of evidence?

           Metaphysics is the investigation of the nature of reality. In this course we wrestle with some of the most fundamental questions we are capable of posing, such as: What kinds of things exist? Are there minds or material bodies? What, for that matter, is existence? Is change illusory? What is truth? To what extent is reality independent of our thoughts about it? What is the difference between the possible and the actual? Are human actions free or causally determined? What is a person?

           “Socrates was poisoned.” With those vocal sounds or marks on a page, I can make a claim about someone who lived in the distant past. How is that possible? How do our words manage to pick out or latch onto particular portions of reality, even ones with which we’ve never had any contact? How does language enable us to convey thoughts about everything from Abu Dhabi, to the hopes of a friend, to the stars beyond our galaxy? For that matter, what are the thoughts, or the meanings, that our words carry or communicate? We explore these and other philosophical questions about language through a reading of seminal works by twentieth-century thinkers.

           What is the mind, and what can philosophy tell us about it? How is the mind related to the brain? Are they identical? How can we know when something has a mind? Could a machine have a mind? Could a machine be conscious? What, for that matter, is consciousness? Can consciousness be reconciled with a scientific view of the world? How do our mental states and attitudes, whatever they are, arise from activity in the brain and cause our actions? The rise of cognitive science has shed new light on many of these old questions. Can philosophers and cognitive scientists learn from each other even as they approach the study of the mind in their different ways? We examine various answers to these questions, drawing readings from classical and contemporary philosophy as well as from cognitive science.

           Science is often taken to be a distinctly rational form of empirical inquiry. This course examines various questions concerning the nature and practice of science that arise from this widespread attitude. For example, scientific theories are often thought to be subject to empirical scrutiny in ways that other theories are not. To what extent is this belief well-founded? Is it rational to believe that our best scientific theories are even approximately true? What justifies the claim that different types of evidence lend varying degrees of support to a particular theory, or that a single piece of evidence supports one theory more than another? Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific theories provide us with “real” explanations of physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren’t “genuinely explanatory.” To what extent is this true? What exactly is a scientific explanation, and how is it different (if at all) from a mere prediction or mathematical derivation? Can false theories provide good explanations? Some familiarity with science would be helpful but is not required.

           What are our most basic values? What are the ethical principles by which we should judge our actions, ourselves, and our lives? What is involved in living a good human life? How can we reconcile the demands of morality with the personal obligations that spring from friendships and other relationships? Do the ends ever justify the means? We will grapple with these and other questions as we explore three of the most influential theories in Western ethical philosophy: Aristotle’s ethics of virtue, Immanuel Kant’s moral rationalism, and John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism. We will also encounter one of modern morality’s harshest critics: Friedrich Nietzsche.

           Torture, abortion, taxes, physician-assisted suicide, terrorism. People disagree fiercely about the morality of these and countless other human concerns. What moral theories and concepts shape these debates? Can we use these debates to refine or evaluate those theories and concepts?  Is it possible to find common ground in shared ethical principles that will allow us to engage in rational debates rather than in disrespectful shouting matches (or worse)? These will be our guiding question as we investigate many of the contemporary moral issues that divide us.

           An examinaton of the pressing moral questons that arise in medical practice and research. Do we have a basic right to health care? Are euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide ever morally permissible? Do we have the right to decide the course of our medical treatment, or to determine the timing and manner of our own deaths? Do we have a right to privacy and confidentiality? Should we allow medical research that harms animals (or that makes use of human stem cells)? Are there compelling moral objections to genetic testing or genetic engineering?

           This course addresses a number of questions that arise in philosophical discussions of the arts. What is art, and how do we evaluate it? Is there a standard of taste? Are there special aesthetic properties? Is there a special aesthetic attitude or a special aesthetic experience? Does it matter for the aesthetic value of a supposed work of art if it is a forgery? What is beauty, and how is it related to the sublime? What is the relation between aesthetic and moral values? Can there be great works of art that are morally bad? Why do we feel for fictional characters? Why do we enjoy horror films? How and what do pictures represent? How does music express emotions? What is it to give an ‘authentic’ performance of a piece of music? How does our aesthetic appreciation of art differ from our aesthetic appreciation of nature?

           The state has authority over its citizens: if you fail to comply with its dictates, you can be punished. What justifies the state’s exercise of such authority? Could it be justified because we have at least implicitly given out consent to it? This is only one central question in political philosophy. Others include: What form of government best serves the people? Who are the people, anyway? What is justice? Do we have fundamental rights to property or to free expression? If so, what is the source of these rights? What is freedom, and are there different kinds? What is the proper relation between freedom and equality? Is equality desirable? Can we live in a genuine community that is not a community of equals? As we grapple with such questions, we draw on writings from both classical and contemporary philosophers.

           An advanced investigation of various aspects of symbolic logic and reasoning, with an emphasis on subjects of philosophical relevance. Specific topics vary by semester, but are generally drawn from the following: modal logic (the study of reasoning about necessity, possibility, counterfactuals, and tense); metalogic (the study of provability, completeness, and other higher-order properties of logical systems); nonclassical logic (the study of three-valued logical systems, free logics, and the logic of relevance); and mathematical logic (the study of logical systems intended to model arithmetic reasoning).

           The world has more and less fundamental aspects. Quarks, bosons, and gravity are likely among the fundamental features. Cars, koalas, and coffees are not. The latter metaphysically depend on the former. The relation of metaphysical dependence, or ground, has applications in a wide variety of philosophical areas, from metaphysics to philosophy of mind to metaethics. For the most part, physics is in the business of discovering the fundamental features of reality. But debates about methodology in the search for the fundamental have rich philosophical dimensions. What is the nature of the relation of metaphysical dependence? Is it a genuinely explanatory notion? What are the rules of the game for positing relations of metaphysical dependence? When should we take some feature as fundamental? What role do our epistemic limitations play in the search for the fundamental? Need there be a fundamental level at all, or might there be an infinite descent of ever deeper levels? How can thinking in terms of fundamentality, or dependence, shed light on philosophical debates? No knowledge of physics is required.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. In the tutorial, students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty member to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a senior thesis. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the senior thesis. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines, such as the arts, and the natural and social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant.

           Jiu Jitsu is a strategic grappling sport where one manipulates an opponent’s force against himself rather than confronting it with one’s own force. Individuals learn how to apply the fundamental techniques of Jiu Jitsu, including positioning, leverage, joint locks, escapes, submissions, and self-defense.

           Karting is a motor sport with small, open, four- wheeled vehicles racing on scaled-down circuits. In addition to developing quick reflexes, precision vehicle control, and decision-making skills, individuals gain a basic understanding of what can be altered to try to improve the competitiveness of the kart, including tire pressure, gearing, seat position, and chassis stiffness. The driver fitness portion of the class focuses on the physical fitness training necessary to effectively compete as a race car driver, including strength and cardiovascular training so as to handle steering, braking and the G-forces associated therewith.

           Total Fitness describes its strength and conditioning program as “constantly varied, high intensity, functional movement”. It is a program geared to prepare the body for better fitness by not focusing on any one activity. Rather, Total Fitness wants the body prepared for any and all activities or sports. It focuses on core strengthening and conditioning. It is not the same routine every day, but a regular mixture of activities designed to activate and strengthen various core and major muscle groups from a variety of tasks. Workouts are typically short—20 minutes or less—and intense, demanding all-out physical exertion. They combine movements such as sprinting, rowing, jumping rope, climbing rope, flipping tires, weightlifting, and carrying sandbags, kettlebells etc. CrossFit has attracted elite athletes, military personnel, police officers and now regular people who want to achieve higher levels of fitness. The Total Fitness program seeks to achieve this through balance in ten fitness categories: heart and lung endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance and accuracy.

           This is a PADI Certified Open Water Scuba Diving Course. Individuals who successfully complete this class are awarded an internationally recognized certificate in scuba diving. Prerequisites: (1) the ability to swim continuously for 200meter or 300meter with mask/fin snorkel, (2) the ability to swim/float in water too deep to stand in for 10minutes, (3) confidence in open water, and (4) the completion of a medical questionnaire with physician’s consent, PE credit will be awarded upon obtaining a PADI Open Water Dive qualification prior to the end of the class. Given the progressive nature of instruction; i.e. later classes are entirely dependent upon earlier classes, students must attend all sessions in the order offered.  If a session is missed, the affected student is solely responsible for scheduling and paying for the makeup session. All makeup sessions must be completed prior to the next regularly scheduled session.

           This course is a combination of three corrective exercise methods, namely Trigger Point Therapy, Rehabilitation and Muscle Activation.
           <br/>
           Trigger Point Therapy will relieve the muscle tightness and increase range of motion, facilitating efficient blood circulation. This actually increases energy levels, muscle strength and delays fatigue which is invaluable to the competitive athlete. The range of motion will enable you to use the full potential of the muscle and the restored muscle with improved blood supply; will be able to work harder for much longer, without tightening up on you. Essentially what this amounts to is a dramatic Improvement in your sports performance.
           <br/>
           Rehabilitation of muscles can bring about reduced pain and accelerated healing of injured tissue, Improved range of motion and muscle mass, Strengthening, conditioning, and weight loss and better overall well-being and improved quality of life.
           <br/>
           Muscle activation looks at the body compensations as it loses its ability to engage the prime movers of the body. These compensations reduce the ability of the body to work at its highest effectiveness, and increase the risk of injury.

           Kettlebells are cast iron weights shaped like a ball with a handle for easy gripping. Kettlebells offer a different kind of training using dynamic moves targeting almost every aspect of fitness – endurance, strength, balance, agility and cardio endurance. Kettlebell exercises are in their nature holistic; therefore they work several muscles simultaneously and may be repeated continuously for several minutes or with short breaks. This combination makes the exercise partially aerobic and more similar to High-intensity interval training rather than to traditional weight lifting. This class will be taught by an in-house instructor.

           Individuals learn the basic disciplines of yoga, focusing on body awareness, appropriate warm ups, beginning yoga postures, breathing, and relaxation skills. Upon successful completion, students understand and are able to demonstrate the basic components of yoga practice, including safe, stable body alignment and classic yoga postures. Phoenix Rising Yoga (PRY) works on the assumption that the body and mind are not separate, and that physical and emotional issues are profoundly connected. As a body-based, approach to self-awareness, PRY uses assisted yoga postures accompanied by facilitative dialogue that can help you to deepen your connection to your inner experiences and open the doors to  greater self-awareness. This, in turn, has the potential to facilitate the identification and practice of the next steps in your life’s journey. This course will be taught by contracted instructors.

           An outdoor workout is your opportunity to let loose. You're not locked into the gym, not to your spreadsheet of weights and reps. Think of this as an opportunity to try new things and get creative about challenging your body. The sample outdoor circuit workout below should take about 60 minutes to complete. Use this workout as a template that you can modify with other exercises and cardio types throughout your vacation or if you get bored of typical gym.

           Speed and agility training can help you develop explosive power and athleticism for any sport or fitness goal. Training to develop speed and agility also provides a great way to mix up your regular workouts with some fun, metabolically challenging exercises. Also creates unique, proprioceptive challenges that reinforce muscle firing sequences and motor patterns that transfer directly into movements commonly found in sport and life.

           This course is for anyone who wants a fun and educational introduction to rock climbing. Rock climbing is a fantastic way to get fit, build strength and stamina – it’s a myth that you need to have exceptional upper body strength; a positive attitude will get you a long way! You will look at all the essential skills to get you started, learning simple rope work, belaying (controlling the rope for the climber), single pitch climbing, abseiling and use of technical equipment. We will use an indoor climbing wall for all lessons.

You will learn the rules of the game and how to improve your strength, fitness, speed and flexibility.

           The word Quidditch may or may not sound familiar to you, depending on whether you are familiar with the Harry Potter series. With a broom planted between their legs, players will be taught how to dodge, weave, throw and catch. Having to keep the broom between your legs serves as a vital handicap to mobility, stability and throwing accuracy, encouraging players to develop a precise throwing arm and positional awareness. A fun new PE course, Quidditch is fast-paced game, which is growing in popularity throughout colleges around the world.

           Quantum mechanics is both a fundamental departure from the classical understanding of the universe and one of the foundational theories on which modern physics is based. Designed to provide a rigorous mathematical introduction to quantum mechanics, this course covers the Schrödinger and Heisenberg description of quantum systems, application to basic atomic structure and simple boundary condition problems, quantum statistics, perturbation theory, and scattering.

           In this course the students will assemble and perform some key experiments of modern physics, testing their capabilities as experimental physicists beyond what is already done in previous courses. Some of the experiments are: muon decay, two-slit interference, interferometry, Fabry-Perot cavity, nuclear magnetic resonance. Students will perform all phases of the experiments starting from the initial step to presenting their results in a final seminar after analyzing the data and writing a short paper. They will work in groups (max 3 people), refining their communication and collaboration skills.

           Multi-wavelength astronomy is more an observational science than an experimental one. The prime source of our information is light, and until the 20th century, that meant only optical light, but starting with the discovery of cosmic radio waves in 1931, the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up to astronomers. Each region of the spectrum (radio, microwave, infrared, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray) requires different detection technologies and analysis techniques. Each waveband tells us about different aspects of astronomical sources and the Universe as a whole. This course will provide an overview of multi-wavelength astronomy: the telescopes, techniques, emission mechanisms, sources, and primary science questions relevant to each observing band. A good understanding of basic physics will be assumed, but no specialized knowledge in astronomy or advanced physics is required.

           The capstone seminar provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD physicists and others in related fields. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.  Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

           This course introduces the basic concepts of elementary game theory in a way that allows students to use them in solving simple problems. Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner’s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.

           This course continues the study of game theory and its applications to the social sciences. The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

           This course offers a broad overview of behavioral social science, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand social processes. The course introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision-making. The course is divided into two parts, the first concentrating on the psychology of individual decision-making and the second emphasizing the social psychology of group behavior. In each case, the focus is on how behavioral research might potentially enrich “classical” theories, such as the choice-based theory of revealed preference. The course then applies these concepts to various topics within social science, including the study of systematic biases in group decision-making, the role of the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies.

           This course addresses key theoretical and empirical topics in political psychology, drawing in both the experimental tradition of social psychology and the survey-based tradition of political science. Consideration is given to the political psychology of collective public behavior, including issues of social identity, intergroup relations, and group interaction, as well as individual political attitude formation and decision-making. Social and psychological antecedents and consequences of political orientation and ideological opinions are also addressed.

           In recent years, scholars and policy practitioners have begun to use experimental methods, imported from the natural sciences, as a new means of evaluating public policies and learning about political processes more generally. This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles of social scientific experimentation and its uses, with a particular emphasis on issues related to economic and political development, including the use of randomized control trials to evaluate the effectiveness of aid programs, methods of improving citizen representation and local governance in development contexts, and issues of intergroup relations and conflict resolution.

           Students learn how political scientists look at the world and approach problems. The course focuses on individual decision makers in the world of politics (citizens, voters, legislators, executives, judges) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape political outcomes. Students study the formal modeling of political behavior and analyze the theories of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action). The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to illustrate how these models of political behavior and institutions can shed light on current political events.

           In this course we draw on both theory and evidence to investigate the interplay between voters’ preferences and electoral rules in modern democracies. We begin by thinking about voters’ utility functions: what kinds of returns do citizens get from voting? How do voters in different democracies weigh candidates’ policy positions, information about economic performance, and their partisan affiliations? We then consider how different electoral institutions aggregate voters’ preferences and the effects of varying electoral rules on party competition, including the number and ideological character of parties, and the responsiveness of elected officials to voter preferences.

           This course examines several important questions about judicial institutions. Looking at both theory and evidence, we ask how judges in different institutional settings decide cases. In what ways, if any, are judges different from legislators? How do judges interact on multimember courts? How do judges weigh legal, policy, and political actors? We also ask about the consequences of different judicial institutions for policy outcomes. For example, we examine the consequences of varying degrees of judicial independence, including elected vs. appointed judges, fixed terms vs. life terms, and constitutional vs. statutory grants of jurisdiction.

           The course explores recent research on the economic causes and consequences of differences in political institutions: authoritarian vs. democratic in general, and various kinds of authoritarian (military, personalistic, etc.) and democratic (chiefly proportional vs. majoritarian and parliamentary vs. presidential) regimes. Among the economic aspects to be considered are: the wealth and economic inequality in the given society; who garners the rents that the given regime offers; and the degree of oligopoly versus competition that characterizes economic policy.

           It is now widely acknowledged that politics plays a central role in influencing economic development. This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

           This course examines how legislation and regulation influence the structure of financial markets, and how players in these markets intervene in the political process to create or modify legislative and regulatory outcomes. Particular emphasis is placed on the United States, although international comparisons are also present. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.

           This course provides an introduction to political economy and policymaking in large cities and metropolitan areas. The course examines the institutional, economic, political, and demographic settings that distinguish urban policymaking, primarily in the United States. We begin by analyzing the institutions of local government and their role in the U.S. federal system, the sources of urban growth, competition among cities, and the importance of real estate markets in shaping local politics. We next study several specific urban issues including concentrated poverty, racial conflict, housing, governmental fragmentation, and sprawl. Although the course focuses on large central cities, we pay attention to the suburbanization of population and employment, politics in suburbia, and citysuburb relations. Finally, students are introduced to the latest research on social interactions in cities— with a focus on social capital, neighborhood and peer effects, and human capital spillovers.

           In this course, we examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? What are the causes and consequences of bureaucratic corruption, and how can it be minimized? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas.

           Political culture is one of the central research themes in contemporary political science. Eckstein considers the political culture approach as "one of the two still viable general approaches to political theory and explanation…the other still being political rational choice theory." This course examines major approaches to political culture and their relationship to democratic development. We discuss questions of how to define political culture, how political culture can be studied, and how it relates to democratic politics and political performance. The pros and cons of the political culture approach will be discussed in the concluding session.

           Often described as the founder of the modern science of politics, Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) was also a Florentine diplomat and civil servant who drew upon his deep understanding of Roman history to interpret the colorful, tumultuous, duplicitous, and often violent politics of Renaissance Italy. This class involves a careful reading and analysis of his masterpiece,
           <em>
            The Prince,
           </em>
           in its historical context, with a focus on its principal theme, namely how and why political leaders gain and lose power. Students also study selected portions of
           <em>
            The Discourses.
           </em>
           In order to understand the nature of Machiavelli’s "republicanism" and how it relates to the advice and warnings he gave to princes. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to Machiavelli’s tomb in Santa Croce; the
           <em>
            David
           </em>
           of Verrocchio in the Bargello (a statue that Machiavelli saw every day on his way to his office); and the estate at Sant’Andrea in Percussina, near San Casciano in Val di Pesa, where Machiavelli retired to write
           <em>
            The Prince.
           </em>

           Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

           This course introduces students to the study of comparative politics and the study of domestic political institutions around the world. The course emphasizes the use of theory and evidence to generate and test hypotheses about both the causes and the consequences of the observed variation in domestic political institutions. For example, the course investigates the factors that lead some countries to democratize, and others to institute authoritarian governments, as well as the consequences of those institutional choices for policy outcomes. The course also looks at the variations in institutional arrangements within both democratic and non-democratic governments.

           A focus on the "Arab Middle East" presupposes that regional culture is a significant factor in explaining political outcomes in the region. For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of "Arab exceptionalism". This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.

           How did the borders of South Asian countries come to be formed? What explains the variation in the types of regimes—democratic and authoritarian— across South Asia? To what extent do these countries vary in the structure of their states as well as regimes? How does ethnic diversity affect the politics of South Asian countries? What is the pattern of economic growth across these countries, and their human development record and why? What explains the high levels of violence in some South Asian countries and patterns of variation across these countries? These are some of the questions that this course addresses, with a primary focus on India and a secondary focus on Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan. Although students learn a vast number of facts about the history and politics of the region, the primary purpose of the course is to identify overarching patterns that characterize the politics of these regions—and to teach students to think analytically and comparatively about these patterns.

           This course explores the politics of the EU, of central and eastern Europe, and of western Europe. With regard to the EU, classical governance issues of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making are both sharply drawn and the subject of explicit agreements between states. These same issues were explicitly confronted in the recent past by those involved in democratization and democratic consolidation central and eastern Europe. Western Europe is the intellectual "home" to many of the classical models of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making, yet all countries, and especially smaller countries, are now forced to adapt these models in a setting where the traditional notion of the "stand alone" nation-state is becoming ever less relevant.

           This course has as a central focus the political institutions of the United States and the effects of those institutions on policy outcomes. The course also places these institutions in the context of those of other wealthy democracies, as a means of illustrating several of the unique features of American political institutions. Topics covered in the course include separation of powers, federalism, and single-member district electoral rules.

           The course provides students with an opportunity to engage in a multifaceted examination of Arab perceptions of the U.S. and the West, and Western perceptions of the Arab world. Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. They design and execute a public opinion survey of U.S. and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other—using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.

           This course introduces students to many aspects of legislative politics across the democratic world, addressing the questions of what legislatures do during a given legislative period and why they do this. The course provides students with a set of tools for understanding how legislatures are organized and how legislators behave. Topics examined include: congressional and parliamentary elections; the role of political parties and interest groups in lawmaking and elections; the impact of internal organization of legislatures on lawmaking; and "policy space" within which legislative decision making takes place.

           Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

           In recent years, social media usage (Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Tumbler, etc.) has exploded to such an extent that it is impossible to believe it does not have an effect on the political behavior of citizens. The question remains, though, of how exactly does it matter? This is the focus of our course. In the morning sessions, student are first introduced to the most important topics of political behavior—voting, turnout, partisanship, public opinion formation, and protests and social movements—and then to the much newer literature on the usage of social media. In the afternoon sessions, students both visit social media companies located in New York City, and are taught the necessary tools to work on their own original research projects. These research projects are conducted in conjunction with NYU’s new Social Media and Political Participation laboratory (smapp.nyu.edu).

           The goal of this course is to introduce participants to the study of African politics from multiple methodological approaches and in a number of African contexts. The course begins with the historical roots of contemporary African politics, exploring how pre-colonial institutions and colonialism shaped African politics at independence. Then, we survey the political and economic strategies of leaders post-independence and the factors shaping those strategies. We examine the causes and consequences of poor governance, and evaluate the recent patterns of redemocratization on the continent. The course closes with a discussion of present-day challenges: electoral malfeasance, public health crises, the “new” populism, and China in Africa.

           The goal of this course is to introduce the basic analytical concepts and techniques that are essential for understanding international politics. We are especially concerned with analytically exploring major issues in international politics, such as the causes of war, the emergence of cooperative trade relations between states, the origins and functioning of international organizations such as the United Nations, and the political determinants of financial crises. The focus of the course is neither historical nor descriptive; rather, it requires students to exercise skills in logic and to think of imaginative ways to apply subtle techniques to gain a clearer grasp of the above political issues.

           This course explores the conditions that lead to the initiation, escalation, spread, termination, and consequences of international conflict as well as the circumstances that promote, preserve, or restore peace. The main objective is to identify strategies that promote cooperative solutions to international disputes and to evaluate those strategies in terms of their historical effectiveness. The course emphasizes the application of models of strategic rational action as tools for assessing relations between nations, coupled with statistical and historical analysis of classes of events.

           Prerequisites: Introduction to International Politics.  Domestic political circumstances affect the policy incentives of leaders. Hence domestic political institutions, economic performance, and popularity all influence foreign policy. In turn, international outcomes influence the domestic survival of leaders. This course explores the theoretical linkages between domestic and international events.

           Nation-Building explores the range of strategies which strong states use in order to build the capacity of weak ones. This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is "democracy promotion" a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.

           Civil war continues to be one of the most vexing problems in comparative and international politics. Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

           Insurgencies continue to be a major threat to peace in developing countries. How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency. Students then travel to Kathmandu, Nepal to meet with participants in Nepal's 10-year civil war from 1996 to 2006 and learn their perspectives on these questions obtained from their experiences.

           It is now widely acknowledged that political conflicts play a major role in driving economic development trajectories.  We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America’s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship.  The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two.  The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina’s political conflicts.

           In many respects, the social and political organization of societies has depended on access to and control of energy—whether provided by animals, human labor, or natural resources. The industrial revolution initially occurred in locations where coal was available. The discovery of oil, which provided a more transportable and more powerful source of energy, launched international competition for control of sources of oil. Oil cartels and powerful transnational oil companies have played vital roles in the politics, economics, and international policies of developed and developing nations, and access to oil has shaped the relationship of the Middle East to the world from the early 20th century to the present. This course explores these historical developments and considers how the need for energy has defined domestic politics and world developments over the past two centuries. Taking advantage of our location in Abu Dhabi, the course explores the relationship of an oil-producing region to the rest of the world.

           Are Emerging Powers emerging, and are they powers? The course will consider the emerging "market" or economic discussion, reviewing what academics, the press, financial institutions, etc., mean when they speak of these countries, with acronyms such as BRICs, BRICS, MINT, and others.  What is the key factor: size, growth, novelty,  potential or promise? Which of all of these questions is truly relevant and important?  The second part of the class will examine regional, geopolitical issues: are these countries important actors in their regions? Why or why not, and how does their economic performance influence their regional political action (domestic ideological and institutional issues would also be rapidly addressed here)? The third part of the class will turn to international and multilateral factors: are "emerging powers" truly powers? Are they all the same? Do others see them as powers? How do they express their economic success or geographic and demographic clout in the international arena?

           Social scientists and policy analysts rely heavily on research drawing on observational data. Students learn to manage and analyze such data and to deploy statistical techniques that are common in these applications, with an emphasis on how to translate social science theory into empirical research. Topics include review of basic regression analysis, building multivariate analytical models, and regression analysis with limited dependent variables. The course emphasizes practical training in these skills as well as evaluation, replication, and critical analysis of research conducted in the social science literature. The course assumes knowledge of the material covered in Statistics for Social and Behavioral Sciences and is designed as alternative for students in the social sciences who are not taking

           This course offers an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. It affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, which is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human.

           This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major.

           Biopsychology is concerned with the biological basis of psychological processes and behaviors. In this course, students discover connections between psychology and biology, pharmacology, endocrinology, as well as genetics. In particular, students get to know the structure, function and development of the human nervous and hormone system and discuss how such systems can give rise to basic sensory, motor, cognitive, and motivational processes that characterize the human mind. Additionally, through learning about the effects of brain damage, students gain insights on how pathological thoughts and behaviors can be rooted in physiological causes. Finally, students develop a basic understanding of the methodologies used in biopsychology and evaluate the contributions as well as limitations of these approaches.

           Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and human thinking. This course is aimed at providing the student with a better understanding on how we humans perceive and think about ourselves and about the world. This is relevant beyond academic interest in the mind because our perception and thought processes are fraught with biases that nonetheless routinely inform human actions. Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers different aspects of perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision-making. The course emphasizes how psychologists use experiments to learn about the structure of the human mind, including how the mind works and how human thinking, with all its successes and pitfalls, occurs.

           How do we construct a conception of physical reality based on sensory experience? This course provides a survey of basic facts, theories, and methods for studying sensation and perception. The major emphasis is on vision and audition, but other modalities may be covered. Representative topics include: receptor function and physiology; color; motion; depth; psycho physics of detection, discrimination, and appearance; perceptual constancies; adaptation, pattern recognition, and the interaction of knowledge and perception.

           The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.

           This course focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision-making. Decision-making is a critical part of every person’s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We examine formal theories of how people/should/make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision maker.

           This course introduces important concepts from psychology and behavioral economics, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making. The course is divided into two parts, the first concentrating on the psychology of individual decision making and the second emphasizing the social psychology of group behavior. In each case, the focus is on how behavioral research might potentially enrich “classical” economic theories, such as the choice-based theory of revealed preference. The course then applies these concepts to various topics within the social sciences, including the study of systematic biases in group decision-making, the role of the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies.

           This course introduces students to the field of cognitive science through an examination of language behavior, one of the major domains of inquiry in the discipline. Begins with interactive discussions of how best to characterize and study the mind. These principles are then illustrated through an examination of research and theories related to language representation and use. The course draws from research in both formal linguistics and psycholinguistics.

           A hands-on introduction to magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a cognitive neuroscience technique, with a focus on the neural basis of language. MEG measures the magnetic fields generated by neural activity and offers the best combination of temporal and spatial accuracy of extant non-invasive cognitive neuroscience techniques. As part of the Neuroscience of Language Lab (NeLLab), NYUAD houses a state-of-the-art MEG facility, which will be the primary site for this course. Students execute an MEG project including experimental design, data collection, analysis and write-up of results.

           This course examines the mind and brain of cognitive control - the ability to flexibly adapt our behaviors to achieve our goals. Students will be introduced to key psychological and neuroscientific concepts in the fields of attention, memory, decision-making, and motor control. Discussions will focus on original research, and will involve interactive demonstrations and/or data collection to reproduce seminal research findings. Additionally, the course will cover the brain systems involved in cognitive control, as well as the various tools that researchers use to investigate cognition. As part of the course, students will present and critique research from primary sources, and will write a research proposal aimed at answering novel questions about cognitive control.

           The capstone seminar provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD psychologiosts and others in related fields. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar so that students can begin the Capstone Project by the fall semester of their senior year.  Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

           provides a comprehensive introduction to these two fundamental concepts that are so famously unified in the equality E=mc2. Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

            Foundations of Science 2: Forces and Interactions
           </em>
           introduces students to fundamental forces, including gravity and electrical forces. Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

           focuses on changes in systems in the physical and living worlds. Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

           <em>
            Foundations of Science 4: Form and Function
           </em>
           explores a question applicable to all branches of science: How does the form or shape of a physical entity set its function? This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

           <em>
            Foundations of Science 5: Propagating Change
           </em>
           focuses on disturbances in physical and living systems that bring about change. In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.

           Foundations of Science 6: Oscillations and Uncertainties examines how repetitious or cyclical events, although presumably predictable, are associated with inherent uncertainty in their outcomes. This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.

           The capstone seminar series provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD scientists and mathematicians. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research students identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Research Project in the fall semester of their senior year.

           Beginning in 2014–15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every spring.

           Focuses on the art of scientific problem-solving through theoretical analysis and/or experimental and technical design. The capstone research project provides an opportunity for student teams to use their knowledge and skills to identify and solve a problem or answer a question in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The members of each team, which may well include majors from a wide range of disciplines including students from the humanities and social sciences, design and execute a project under the guidance of a faculty mentor. The projects end with student presentations.

           This course provides an introduction to topics in mathematics immediately relevant for social scientists beginning their studies in Economics, Political Science, or Social Research and Public Policy. Beginning with a review of sets and functions, the course covers key topics in univariate calculus and introduces the notation associated with basic linear algebra. The course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course provides an introduction to mathematics as the lingua franca of modern social sciences, and focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences.

           This course examines the major approaches to empirical studies in the social sciences, and studies the relationship between social questions raised and methods employed. It offers skills in developing research designs for explorative, descriptive, explanatory, and evaluation research. Special attention is paid to causal inference and to the use of experiments in social research.

           The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.

           This course examines historical and contemporary theoretical perspectives on the relationship between political institutions and economic processes. The course introduces students to debates about the role of markets and the governments, mainly focusing on discourses that stem from liberal, conservative, and radical schools of thought. Comparative empirical case studies of capitalistic economic institutions around the world e.g. USA, continental Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East are provided.

           Building on Calculus or Mathematics for Social Scientists I, this course provides a further reaching study of mathematics immediately relevant for social science majors. Beginning with a review of univariate calculus and optimization, the discussion moves to the basics of linear algebra, multivariate calculus and tools related to the constrained optimization of functions. The last set of topics includes introductions to comparative statics and discrete-time dynamic optimization. Note that this course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences, and illustrates the usefulness of mathematical results directly in terms of applications to models of optimizing agents.

           This optional, no-credit seminar is designed to help sophomores and juniors to develop a research proposal for a second term abroad, a capstone project, or an undergraduate research funds application. The seminar meets bi-weekly and will help students to develop strategies to advance from a vague idea to a concrete proposal; to write a concise literature review; and to make an effective case for the chosen research question and methodology.

           Since the 17th century there have been a series of different hegemonic powers within a transnational capitalist economy. This course surveys (a) the history of the capitalist system from Dutch and British hegemony through the American 20th century, the growth of corporations, various approaches to economic development, and the current opening up of the world to new economic powers, and (b) the related political history of European colonialism, nationalism, postcolonial societies, the Cold War, and the emerging multipolar world of today. It considers the nature of crises and social change, efforts to establish stability in the face of conflicts and disruptions, and possible futures open to the contemporary world. The course includes several field trips in the U.A.E.

           The aim of this course is to study human conditions, social arrangements, and social processes which are sites of social, political, cultural, and moral contestations in contemporary societies. They are perceived as ‘social problems’ and divide public opinion about the appropriate ways to protect society from their deleterious effects. Lectures first focus on sociological perspectives on social problems and examine the role of social structure and social processes in their production and reproduction. Subsequent lectures focus on exploring selected social problems such as: suicide, suicide terrorism, euthanasia, aging, genocide, incest, genomics, and religious fundamentalism. The selected social problems are examined in a global perspective, focusing on contemporary industrialized societies.

           In this seminar, students come to understand the diverse and dynamic roles that religious and cultural Islam can play in contemporary societies, especially those in the "Middle East" and North Africa. After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

           What is globalization, and what are the implications of living in a "global world" for education? How can education be used as a tool to promote global social justice and prosperity? This course explores these questions by first examining various theoretical perspectives on globalization, then analyzing several major themes associated with globalization and education. Case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America provide concrete examples of how global forces are changing the content and context of education internationally.

           This seminar traces the birth and spread of the ghetto as a social form and as an idea from the early modern era to the present. It begins in Venice with the first community to carry that name, and ends with Gaza, a place which the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in

           the Palestinian Territories has argued evokes the worst historic memories of ghettoization. Along the way we explore the early modern Jewish ghettos of Frankfurt, Prague and Rome; Nazi-controlled ghettos in Poland during World War II; Jewish immigrant ghettos of early 20th-century New York and Chicago; and Black ghettos in northern U.S. cities from World War II to the present. Efforts to generalize to gay communities, Chinatowns, and barrios are also considered. As we trace the spread of the ghetto idea across history, we ask: what is it about this 16th century concept, coined for a now obsolete Jewish residential area, that continues to concern and captivate us?

           Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (‘tipping points’), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

           Revolutions mean purposive and contentious efforts to re-engineer whole societies according to the visions of justice and progress. What social theories better explain these exuberant, extraordinary events? How did the revolutionaries, their strategies, and programs evolve during the modern epoch? What typically happened after taking power? Why are there so many wars and revolutionary dictatorships? This course introduces the recent theoretical advances in understanding contentious mass politics in relation to the formation of modern states, democratization, socialism, and nationalism. Empirical examples include: the American Independence of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789; the communist revolutions in Russia and China; the anti-colonial movements of the 20th century in India, South Africa and Cuba; and the youth revolts of 1968 in the West, 1979 in Iran, 1989 in the Soviet bloc, and the newest rebellions of the 2010s in the Middle East.

           In this seminar, students explore the diverse and dynamic manifestations of religion in social life—as a personal and collective experience, an individual and group identity, and a code for moral behavior—and examine how these social uses of religion impact various spheres of society. After considering classic social theories of religion, we will look at substantive cases from the United States, Egypt, Iran, China, and Venezuela to investigate how and why religious meanings and identities come to matter (or not) in arenas of gender equality, political mobilization, nation-state structures, everyday intergroup interactions, and the law and punishment. Overall, this course aims to provide students with the theoretical frameworks and substantive background necessary to analyze the workings of religion and religious identity in modern societies.

           This course is an introduction to the study of social problems through exploration of three primary issues in New York City: homelessness, mental illness and child welfare. It encompasses: the history of each social condition; a review of research in each area and micro and macro (governmental) approaches to these problems. Students have the opportunity to visit agencies, to meet with professionals and consumers of service and to compare the government and American public policy response to these problems with that of their home country. Presentations are made by guest speakers who are experts in each of these areas.

           This course introduces students to survey research. It discusses different sampling procedures, issues of questionnaire construction, measurements of values and beliefs, and interviewing techniques. It also introduces students to standard surveys, such as the General Population Survey, Eurobaromoter, and surveys carried out in the Middle East in the past decades. In their final paper, students analyze data from one of the existing survey data sets.

           This course explores the concepts of race and ethnicity both in international comparative perspective, and with a special focus on their meaning and manifestations in the U.A.E.  Race and ethnicity are both ways of classifying human groups that arise under certain historical circumstances, with race in particular emerging in the contexts of imperialism and slavery.  Students will consider how migration, state policies, and economic organization shape the classification and characterization of racial and ethnic groups, and will select national case studies to research independently.  In both the classroom and a series of encounters scheduled with members of diverse ethnic groups in the U.A.E., students will also learn and apply social scientific methods like ethnography and content analysis in order to gauge stratification, prejudice and discrimination in diverse areas of social life.

           This course explores the concepts of race and ethnicity both in international comparative perspective, and with a special focus on their meaning and manifestations in the U.A.E. Race and ethnicity are both ways of classifying human groups that arise under certain historical circumstances, with race in particular emerging in the contexts of imperialism and slavery. Students consider how migration, state policies, and economic organization shape the classification and characterization of racial and ethnic groups, and select national case studies to research independently. In both the classroom and a series of encounters scheduled with members of diverse ethnic groups in the U.A.E., students will also learn and apply social scientific methods like ethnography and content analysis in order to gauge stratification, prejudice and discrimination in diverse areas of social life.

           Whether as heroes or agents of creative destruction, entrepreneurs and their innovations have had a transformative influence on modern economic growth and the wealth of nations. The first part of the seminar introduces the classical and contemporary writings on the rise of entrepreneurial capitalism in the West and the global diffusion of modern entrepreneurial spirit and firm. Classical approaches pioneered the study of modern entrepreneurship in its rational orientation to profit-making through innovative activity. Contemporary approaches shift the emphasis away from analysis of individual attributes and agency to focus on examining the role of social networks, organizational forms, and institutional environment in facilitating entrepreneurial activity. In the part of the seminar, we focus on research on entrepreneurship using secondary sources and data available through the internet.

           Social scientists who study science often make a simple, but controversial claim: that science is fundamentally shaped by social forces. This premise challenges contemporary understanding of science as producing true, objective knowledge that is independent of culture and social structure. We study debates about the nature of science versus religion, Western versus non-Western knowledge, and the physical versus social sciences in order to form our own conclusions about the relationship between science and society.

           This course examines very personal areas of life— romantic relationships, marriage, and sexuality. Behavior in these private realms is strongly affected by culture, economics, and politics, and varies across societies and subgroups within societies. Topics include how young adults find romantic partners, changing standards of permissible sexual behavior, attitudes toward same-sex relationships, changing meanings of marriage, and public policies directed at these behaviors.

           In every society, whether one is born male or female affects how one is expected to behave and the opportunities one confronts. However, how gender is organized varies between societies and across time. This course draws upon research from sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology to examine gender, providing information on how gender is organized in various parts of the world. Topics include how male and female children are socialized, women’s and men’s roles in the family, trends in women’s education and employment, the sex gap in pay, and how gender is affected by public policies.

           The rapid increase in wealth and income inequality in many countries, often concentrated and most severe in the world’s leading cities, is the subject of this course. Using New York City as our laboratory, we explore some of the ways in which wealth and power are created and maintained, as well as examining some of the social consequences of high levels of inequality for families and communities. Readings and lectures explore the social and political economy of inequality through the work of contemporary social science. We will deepen our understanding of key issues through field trips, films, guest lectures, and meetings with key leaders in the world of finance and business, government, and nongovernmental groups working to alleviate some of the most serious consequences of poverty and inequality in New York.

           This course asks: How can human rights advocates better operationalize 20th century tools to achieve better 21st century human rights outcomes? It examines case studies at the intersection of law, politics, policy and institutions to determine how  to achieve better human rights policy outcomes. Too often, human rights advocates -- both inside and outside governments-- fail to achieve their desired outcomes because they cannot manage politics, harness incentives and institutions, or deploy law in a way that operationalizes the principles they value. This course begins with an overview of the institutions, strategy, law, and process of human rights. We then explore a number of case studies that illustrate cutting-edge human rights problems, and the various tools that may be employed for their resolution. The course will close with a series of student presentations identifying current issue areas ripe for new and better human rights strategies that might help attack these critical questions.

           Introduction to the foundations and development of the modern welfare state, with an emphasis on Western democracies. The course provides students with the conceptual tools to understand welfare states and the twin pressures they have faced in recent times: population change and globalization. Life courses of individuals and households, for example, pathways in and out of poverty, provide a useful framework for thinking about welfare states and what they do or not do. In addition, much can be learned from a comparative perspective. Topics include poverty, inequality, fertility, health care, education, retirement, and immigration.

           Commonly (and wrongly) people take for granted the existence of such political and cultural units as France and Germany, or Japan and India. But in the Middle East states and national cultures are at the same time ancient and recently created. Here the complex processes of state-formation are still current, and the United Arab Emirates, which is barely forty years old, serves a rich and richly varied example for the comparative understanding of state-building, cultural imagination, and economic development.

           Are Muslims distinct in their wellbeing? In this class students will examine the cumulative trajectories of wellbeing among Muslim populations through the interplay of three core demographic processes: fertility, mortality, and migration. Using Muslim populations as case studies, students will develop skills to create a population profile, learn about past and present characteristics of citizens and migrants, and acquire the knowledge to assess basic measures of population change. This course is designed to help students with conducting their own independent research in the social sciences.

           How does one ‘read the news’? It might be trickier than it sounds. The construction of what becomes ‘news’, its dissemination and interpretation are complex and inherently contentious social processes. Finding your way in the realm of mass communication, propagandistic conflicts, and public debate requires both theoretical lenses and good practical skills which this course intends to supply.

Special attention is paid to the question of urban poverty, debates around "culture of poverty" and "underclass" and it offers a balanced evaluation of various policy recommendations to alleviate poverty.

           Public policy affects our lives in profound ways even when we are not aware of them. What we eat, how we recycle, or when we disclose personal information on the internet are all examples of choices largely determined by public policies. This course is an introduction to public policy, why it is important, and how it involves simultaneous ethical, political, and problem-solving processes. The course introduces students to the ways in which a variety actors and institutions at the national and transnational levels interactively contribute to public policy. The course is divided into two parts. The first part provides an overview of the basic concepts underlying the public policy process and the second part provides critical perspectives on public policy-making in theory and practice.

           Despite the significant progress made towards achieving globally set targets for health in some countries, others—particularly in sub-Saharan Africa—are falling behind. This course introduces students to the main concepts of the public health field and the critical links between global health and social and economic development. Lectures explore major themes in global health, including the social determinants of health, the global distribution of disease burden and risk factors, key measures to address the disease burden in cost-effective ways, and the role of health systems and diverse global actors in responding to the health needs of populations worldwide. The course is global in coverage, but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries and on the health of the poor.

           The relationship between gender, family, sexuality and religion has become a major site of political struggle both in the United States and the Islamic world. Using pilot survey data collected through social network sites in the United States, Egypt and Turkey, this research practicum analyzes the ways in which religious beliefs condition young people’s sexual, gender and familial attitudes and behaviors. Students compare how gender, sexuality and family have been politicized by religious movements.

           Working as a performance company, students learn the fundamentals of collaborative theater-making. Acting and performance are central to the process, but so is the recognition that a performance takes place in a space that has to be invested with rules and conventions before it can tell a story. Exploring the possibilities offered by these rules and conventions is key to understanding the potential for theater as a means of expression and mode of knowledge. Combining the tools and techniques of Aristotle, Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Brecht, Grotowski, Brook, and Bogart, students work in groups to devise and stage silent stories as well as textual scenes to explore what it means to create a theatrical experience. All students participate as directors, actors, designers, and audience, and discuss each other’s work in order to develop a clearer and more objective relationship to their own.

           This course offers engagements with the problems and methods of Art History at an advanced level. It examines in detail works of art that reflect upon tradition, aesthetic experience and art practice in complex ways and does so by situating these examinations in rich historical and theoretical frameworks. The course is open to anyone who has completed either Foundations of Art History I or II and at least one Art History elective but it is designed with Art History juniors especially in mind because the course is, in part, a useful preparation for Capstone work in the senior year. The course is a requirement for all students pursuing the Art History track.

           Students begin to build a performance vocabulary by using a range of techniques for translating the actor’s imagination into stage action. Students are introduced to the internal and external demands of turning psychology into behavior. Students explore acting fundementals, such as investing yourself in the moment, genuinely listening, personalizing fictional material, and playing objectives are initially explored via games, improvisations, and exercises, followed by partnered scene work, ensemble technique, and solo performance.

           A voice and movement course for actors, musicians, and visual artists. We engage the body as an expressive tool in support of artistic craft and technique and build confidence in our ability to translate creative impulses through physical action. The course guides the student through awareness of and release from habitual tensions and into body alignment, breathing, resonators, sound and movement, group interaction, and the exploration of individual and group creativity. We focus on the kinetic application of movement in the art-making process, using core energy, dynamics, breath connection, strength, flexibility, range of motion, stamina, and relaxation techniques in order to strengthen our creative output. The goal is a free voice in a free body and the ability to express thought and emotion with openness and truth.

           In this course students learn to create visceral, theatrical experiences that tell clear stories through deep investigation of what comprises aesthetic experience and the fundamental tenants of design and stage composition. Students will acquire tools to: identify, externalize, and develop aesthetic impulses; actualize the world of a text through simple, powerful choices; facilitate collaborations with a design team; synthesize script analysis and point of view with rich, textured design worlds; develop an empathetic imagination; and build work with generosity toward the audience’s experience.

           A course for theater directors, filmmakers, actors, and visual artists. Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

           Students learn the fundamentals of voice, vocal production, and vocal expression. The course is designed to help students discover their vocal potential, to reduce obstructive physical habits and tensions and to move towards free, full-range voices. This course is built to cultivate vocal-physical development and sensorial acuteness. Students will begin to understand, in themselves, the connection between thought/impulse/idea, voice, communication and audience.

           A study of the pan-European movements that, from the 1880s onward, challenged and revamped the conventions and institutions of 19th-century drama and theater. The new stagecraft associated with Naturalism and Symbolism complemented the new dramatic structures and themes of realism and expression, while the quest for deeper social and psychological truth led to a succession of experiments with theatrical form and presentational protocols. The march of “isms” that characterized the early years of the 20th century— Futurism, Dadaism, Surrealism—continued into the postwar period with new paradigms such as Brecht’s Epic Theater and Artaud’s Theater of Cruelty, and culminated in the high modernism of Theater of the Absurd.

           A study of the origins and development of the two most influential dramatic movements of the past century. After noting such antecedents as 19th-century melodrama and the “well-made play,” we concentrate on the plays and theories of Gerhart Hauptmann, Henrik Ibsen, Anton Chekhov, August Strindberg, Emile Zola, and others. The social and psychological focus of these playwrights is discussed in terms of philosophical influences (Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Darwin) as well as in relation to important theatrical theorists, models, and institutions (Andre Antoine and the Theatre Libre, Konstantin Stanislavski and the Moscow Art Theater). The continuing vitality of realism as well as significant mutations of and modifications to it are traced throughout the century.

           How have different cultures used performance to communicate and for what purposes: social, political, spiritual? This course examines some of the most distinctive and influential performance traditions, past and present, from around the globe, and reflect upon their significance to our contemporary globalized culture. What structural, aesthetic, and expressive possibilities might artists today borrow from, for example, performance forms such as African masquerade, Korean Shamanistic performance, Athenian Tragedy, Indian Sanskrit drama, Medieval Cycle Drama, Iranian Ta’zieh, Roman imperial spectacle, Japanese Kabuki, Italian Commedia dell’arte, and European Modernism?

           An in-depth study of the great tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, the comedies of Aristophanes, and of the theater culture that produced them. We consider such topics as: the relation of the Greek theater to ritual and myth; the role and meaning of the Greek tragic chorus; the importance of the theatrical contest of the City Dionysia; the physical theater space; and the social function of Greek theater in establishing and strengthening Greek democracy. The Greek plays are seen not only as the root of dramatic art in the West, but as repositories of key concepts of Western thought on such subjects as gender relationships, the role of the citizen in a democracy, war, power, and personal responsibility.

           This class examines recent trends in contemporary Arab theatre, contextualizing these within a broader history of Arab performance including film. Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus’s

           An examination of the drama of contemporary playwrights of African descent living in the United States, the Caribbean, and Africa. The works of Nobel Prize-winners Wole Soyinka (Nigeria) and Derek Wolcott (St. Lucia) are supplemented by an exploration of the plays of other important diasporic writers such as Aime Cesaire, and Maryse Conde (Martinique), Ngugi wa Thiong’o (Kenya) and Zakes Mofokeng (South Africa) as well as African American writers such as Lorraine Hansberry and August Wilson. Issues of colonialism, postcolonialism, empowerment, and spirituality are discussed.

           In this course, we critique 20th- and 21st century plays from the African continent, including works from Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Ethiopia, and South Africa (the Sub-Saharan countries) as well as from Tunis, Algeria, Egypt, Libya Morocco, and Tunisia (North African countries). From a variety of critical theoretical discourses, our discussions focus on the theatrical practices demanded by the texts, along with the intersections and divergences of structures and topics shared by continental plays, such as blackness and race, exile, colonialism and post-colonialism, violence, gender inequality, family, moral and social values, interraciality, religion, and political resistance. The plays from North Africa that align with the Arab world will serve as a bridge to introduce noteworthy works from the African diaspora, with plays written by Africans or those of African ancestry living in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

           How do we begin to know each other differently from the way in which dominant social systems and communicative technologies structure our daily interactions?  This question drives art and performance’s “social turn” to real-world collaborations between artists and performers who act in the role of instigators or catalysts with the communities around them. The social turn explicitly rejects the artist’s more traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance and instead proposes that the conscious processes of collaborative engagement -- activist, participatory, coauthored – must be understood and valued as art.  In this intertwining of art with performance, cooperative processes are foregrounded as frameworks to understand and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art history, urban planning, and new media on our lives. The social practice of art proposes that in making encounters where artists engage with the members of communities as “expert participants,” we might construct more livable alternatives through social cooperation.  Art as social practice also insists that this process is an aesthetic practice.   In this course we will read recent critical theories and histories of the aesthetics and politics of the social practice of art, explore case studies of “relational art,” and collaborate on our own “living as form” project that engages with the built and social environment of Abu Dhabi.

Improvisation is used to explore clarity of expression, listening, and specificity in the actor’s task, but the focus is on the creation of character and dramatic worlds. The dramatic literature employed ranges from classical through contemporary playwriting from diverse cultural traditions.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines in the humanities, the natural and the social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the goals of each participant.

           Visual Culture Studies branches away from the traditional preoccupations of Art History towards new subjects and methodologies. It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.

           This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that
           <em>
            customary perception
           </em>
           (drawing what you “know”) is in conflict with
           <em>
            aesthetic perception
           </em>
           (drawing what you actually “see”). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” and “dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.” Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

           Students learn the history, criticism, and variety of theoretical approaches to photography while developing their own skills in the photographic media. The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

           In early sessions students will become familiar with the tools of painting such as brush and palette usage, mixing and blending of colors and the relationship between paint and surface(s). Techniques of painting are interdependent on particular traditions, styles and purposes. Therefore, historical concepts are addressed with assigned readings and power-point discussions about painting as invention and meaning. Later sessions emphasize student inspired “projects,” wherein each student does a series of paintings based on a particular theme or idea. Along the way there will be periodic group critiques with possible trips to museums and other sites. It is important to experience the “cycle of completion” as often as possible. Therefore, students should be prepared to make a lot of paintings.

           Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the 'traces' and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops.  The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the  National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

           Spring 2015 – Contemporary Art – Since the 1960s rise of conceptual art, artists around the world continue to create idea based art using popular imagery, mixed media, photography and new technologies. Considered as the true global art form of the twentieth century, conceptual art manifests itself in ideas that challenge the current sociopolitical forces of our times and the commonly held notions of what art is about. The course will examine contemporary art from the lens of conceptual art focusing on key works by international artists. Student will examine the definition/s of ‘contemporary’ and the current debates around the modern and contemporary in relation to Western and non-Western art. Course complemented with field trips to museums and collections.

           Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.
           <br/>
           The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

           This course investigates the ways in which art emerges over time as a distinct realm of human activity in different regions of the world. Students study what happens when artistic ideas and forms migrate from one geographic region (with its attendant cultural traditions) to another. Students consider how models drawn from evolutionary theory and translation studies can facilitate new ways of understanding the dynamics of the global spread of artistic ideas, forms, and expressions.

           The success of Frank Gehry’s Bilbao Guggenheim may be seen as the culmination of a paradigm shift away from the old idea of the museum as an art vault to a new conception of the museum as a programming center, a venue for high-profile temporary exhibitions, and a tourist attraction. This course explores the consequences for art and scholarship of the recent museum boom and asks what might it take to produce a change of direction.

           This course investigates the social, political, and imaginative roles played by grand architecture from ancient times to the present day. Through such case studies as the Temple of Luxor, Stonehenge, the Taj Mahal, the Hagia Sophia, the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building, and the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, students investigate the historical contexts of monumental buildings and other structures that have been erected to serve as emblems of a national culture, as well as the ways that these monuments take on new life in literature and other forms of culture.

           The garden is one of the oldest modes of human intervention in the environment. This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qu’ran where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational figure in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the peoples of the book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and the seminar examines both. We will study gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. To analyze these works, the course introduces fundamental methods of art history as an academic discipline.  The seminar includes field trips to gardens and collections in the UAE and India, and concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi.

           These courses offer detailed engagements with key works of art -- masterpieces to material culture across a range of media from different times and places -- to develop the critical apparatus of visual analysis. They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required. This course fulfills Art and Art History requirements.

           What did early modern globalization and material exchange across cultures and contact zones look like ? This interdisciplinary seminar will study the material culture produced by Europe’s first sustained overseas contact with the rest of the world by following the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British maritime trade routes from the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. Topics will include formal languages of artistic world-making; interwoven histories of exploration, collecting, and surveillance; technologies of personal or communal identities; and visual aspects of political diplomacy and subversion. Active class participation, brief powerpoint presentations and a research project. An art history course is preferred, but not required.

           In the short period of thirty years art of the Arab world moved from the periphery of the international art world to the center of global visual art production. The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region’s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

           Why has the interpretation of art weighted production over destruction? After all, reformers of all eras have sought to decapitate, maim and otherwise “erase” objects. Taking a long view of iconoclasm as the active interrogation of objects by objects—through case studies from ancient, medieval and reformation art to today’s contemporary crises—this course will consider the power of art from the frankly object-centered perspective of “applied criticism,” censorship and renunciation. Topics will include lineage and cyclical regeneration, protection and preservation, memory and ruin, economies of sight, mimesis and the miraculous object, senses and the infinite hermeneutic, rupture and the failure of the eye, and the hundred-eyed hydra of immediate, interconnected media images that freeze us today. Active class participation, brief powerpoint presentations and a research project. An art history course is preferred, but not required.

           What is “baroque” ? This course attempts to understand the trials and tribulations of an intellectual ideal via recent work in sensory studies, the art of excess understood in terms of the body’s corporeal and spiritual senses. The masterpieces of seventeenth-century Baroque art—the work of Bernini, Rembrandt, Rubens, Velázquez and Vermeer—will be considered from the perspective of style, iconology, allegory, philosophy, and social theory. Topics will include unity and overflow, the sensual economy and its limits, continuity and disruption, anecdote and anachronism, subjectivity and objectivity, reason and the problem of saturated phenomena. Active class participation, brief powerpoint presentations and a research project. An art history course is preferred, but not required.

           These courses offer detailed engagements with key works of art -- masterpieces to material culture across a range of media from different times and places -- to develop the critical apparatus of visual analysis. They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required. This course fulfills Art and Art History requirements.

           This class for experienced students is constructed around a series of projects realized in any available media or medium. How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to “read” and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.

           This course offers engagements with the problems and methods of Art History at an advanced level. It examines in detail works of art that reflect upon tradition, aesthetic experience and art practice in complex ways and does so by situating these examinations in rich historical and theoretical frameworks. The course is open to anyone who has completed either Foundations of Art History I or II and at least one Art History elective but it is designed with Art History juniors especially in mind because the course is, in part, a useful preparation for Capstone work in the senior year. The course is a requirement for all students pursuing the Art History track.

           This course is for juniors and aims to prepare them for their Capstone project in visual arts practice through a deepening exploration of their individual work as young artists, and the contextualization of that work through the work of their peers. It is also open to visual arts majors interested in exhibition preparation. The course includes readings in critical discourses such as art history, critical theory, and exhibition criticism, both contemporary and historical, with a focus on advanced level group critique of student work. This course aims to develop a student’s sense of the context of contemporary and historical art practices, and culminates in a student group exhibition in a professional gallery setting.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines in the humanities, the natural and the social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant.

           The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines in the humanities, the natural and the social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant.

           We tend think of locales as something physical, something experienced. We know where we are (and where we are from) partly because we have physical experiences of those places: a grandmother’s kitchen, a summer cottage, a smell of the ocean, the particular light on Scandinavian summer nights, or the sound of the jungle. Locale is typically the embodied geography of our lives and experiences.  However, what happens when geographies and their relation to identity—national and/or personal—are imagined in cultural products? In this seminar, we will read a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts in order to investigate how space and national and/or personal identity get imagined by the reader and, not least, how the text opens a space for the reader to imagine a world personally unknown.  We will think of the seminar’s foundational texts as being simultaneously in and out of time and space, thereby forcing us to also think about our own lived geographies.
          </p>
          <p>
           We set out by thinking about essays, short stories, and poems that all attempt to capture an experience of self in relation to a locale.  Writers will include Joan Diddion, Richard Blanco, Karen Blixen, Tony Kushner, and Jamaica Kincaid. For the second paper we turn our attention to how the popular genre of crime fiction—from Agatha Christie to Henning Mankell—functions in the construction of imagined geographies. For the third paper, students choose a cultural artifact (poems, plays, monuments, films, memoires, paintings, newspaper articles etc.) and make an argument about the imagining of nation.  Finally, students will produce an oral conference presentation of their research. Theoretical texts include Edward Said, Benedict Anderson, Anthony Kwame Appiah, Judith Butler and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.

          <p>
           Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about ‘Islam’ -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes ‘Islam’, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can—to the unsuspecting observer—seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as ‘informed’ commentary on ‘Islam’ often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of ‘Islam’. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="line-height:1.6em">
            A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

           This course builds upon the skills from Analysis and Expression and the Writing-Intensive Core courses to prepare students for advanced writing across the curriculum.  The course calls upon students to be creative, critical, and curious, as they rigorously practice their written and spoken expression.  Students engage with a variety of texts and research topics to gain greater self-awareness and confidence with their writing.  Each major assignment is the result of a progression of exercises with an emphasis on drafting and revision strategies. Students work collaboratively, offering constructive critique through class discussion, peer workshops, and one-on-one conferences.
          </p>

           Please note: students who have not achieved a pass in the Writing Placement exam, or a pass of 'B' or better in WRIT-AD 110 or WRIT-AD 111X will be dropped from this class prior to the start of the Add/Drop period.
